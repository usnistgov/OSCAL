"FedRAMP officials want to make it easier for agencies to get cloud service providers [authorized]. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Open Security Controls Assessment Language, which speeds up the security controls assessment process through standardization and automation, will be available for testing by the end of [the 2019] fiscal year", Matt Goodrich said at the June 13th, 2018 Advanced Technology Academic Research Center (ATARC) Federal Cloud and Data Center Summit. He was FedRAMP Director at this time.

OSCAL enables automation of FedRAMP’s security control assessments, and tracking of associated risks.

“We think OSCAL will really help agencies transform the way that they are doing their work by making sure that they can use whatever tool that they want to use and automate whatever they can in the process to do their authorizations,” Goodrich said.

“Agencies can partner with vendors for authorizations so vendors don’t need to have a third-party assessor or independent auditor,” Goodrich said. It allows agencies to "bring in new and innovative products from small businesses in a way that is cost affordable," he said.

## Docker - Automating Compliance for Highly Regulated Industries with Docker Enterprise Edition and OSCAL

[Docker Blog](https://blog.docker.com/2018/05/automating-compliance-docker-ee-oscal/)

"Highly-regulated industries like financial services, insurance, and government have their own set of complex and challenging regulatory IT requirements that must be constantly maintained. For this reason, the introduction of new technology can sometimes be difficult. [Docker Enterprise Edition](https://blog.docker.com/2018/04/announcing-docker-enterprise-edition-2-0/) provides these types of organization with both a secure platform on which containers are the foundation for building compliant applications and a workflow for operational governance at scale."

"To address these requirements, Docker has collaborated with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and today, we are excited to announce that Docker is fully embracing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) standard and committing to its future development."

Docker has continued to collaborate with the OSCAL team on the development of OSCAL.
