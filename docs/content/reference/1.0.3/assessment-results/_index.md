The following reference documentation is available for the OSCAL Assessment Results model.

- **[Conceptual Overview](/concepts/layer/assessment/assessment-results/):** Provides a high-level overview of the model's intended purpose and role in the [OSCAL architecture](/concepts/layer/). Describes the model's purpose, target audience, and key concepts.
- **Outline ([JSON/YAML](json-outline/), [XML](xml-outline/)):** Provides a brief listing of the model's information items organized hierarchically. Useful for understanding the structure and basic syntax of the model in a given format.
- **Reference ([JSON/YAML](json-reference/), [XML](xml-reference/)):** Provides a detailed description of the structure and syntax for the model's information items organized hierarchically. Useful for understanding how to use information items within the model in the given format. 
- **Index ([JSON/YAML](json-index/), [XML](xml-index/)):** Provides a listing of the model's information items organized by where they are used.
- **Definitions ([JSON/YAML](json-definitions/), [XML](xml-definitions/)):** Provides a reference for the XML Schema types and JSON Schema definitions derived from this model's [metaschema](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/v1.0.3/src/metaschema/oscal_assessment-results). A metaschema is used to [express the model](/concepts/layer/overview/#modeling-approach) in a format agnostic way, that is then used to generate the XML and JSON Schema, XML <-> JSON content converters, and this reference documentation.
