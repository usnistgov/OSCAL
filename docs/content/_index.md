NIST and the community will maintain a set of OSCAL models for organizations and service providers to facilitate seamless, continuous security assessment by exchanging information about system implementation and analysis without vendor lock-in. ​

Community engagement and collaboration will mature OSCAL models faster and drive the broadest international adoption possible in public and private sectors.

# Use Information in OSCAL Formats

Control-based information expressed using OSCAL formats allows you to:

- Easily access control information from security and privacy control catalogs
- Establish and share machine-readable control baselines
- Maintain and share actionable, up-to-date information about how controls are implemented in your systems
- Automate the monitoring and assessment of your system control implementation effectiveness

If you are new to the OSCAL project, we provide [learning materials](learn/) for the project.
