The [OSCAL models](/documentation/schema/) provide standardized formats for exchanging control, control implementation, and control assessment information in XML, JSON, and YAML. These formats allow tools this information to be exchanged between tools and for individual tools to process exchanged data, supporting analytics, user interaction, and increased automation.

Tools exist that support the use of the OSCAL models. These tools are listed below in the following categories:

- OSCAL Project provided tools and libraries
- Open Source Tools provided by 3rd parties

If you have produced a tool that supports the OSCAL formats that you would like to have listed on this page, please [contact us](/contribute/contact/).

## OSCAL Project: Open Source Tools and Libraries

- **[OSCAL Java Library](https://github.com/usnistgov/liboscal-java):** Provides a Java-based programming API for reading and writing content conformant to the OSCAL XML, JSON, and YAML based models. This library is kept up-to-date with the [latest formats](/documentation/schema/) provided by the OSCAL project.
- **[XSLT Tooling](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-tools/tree/master/xslt):** A variety of Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Transformations (XSLT), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and related utilities for authoring, converting, and publishing OSCAL content in various forms.

## Community: Open Source Tools and Libraries

- **[OSCALkit](https://github.com/docker/oscalkit):** Provides a GoLang SDK for OSCAL. Converts OSCAL XML -> JSON (and vice versa). Converts [OpenControl](https://open-control.org/) projects into OSCAL.
- **[OSCAL GUI](https://github.com/brianrufgsa/OSCAL-GUI):** A proof of concept GUI tool for interacting with OSCAL content based on [OSCAL milestone 2](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/releases/tag/v1.0.0-milestone2).
