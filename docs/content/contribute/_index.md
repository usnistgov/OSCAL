We are excited that you want to contribute to the OSCAL project. We are striving to provide a collaborative environment for professionals to contribute to the project's goals and objectives. A primary focus of this project is to improve security assessment efficiency, accuracy, and consistency on the basis of real-world experience with the technology used in this space. The language we develop must be well-defined, with easy to use formats that improve both the User Experience (UX) and the Machine Experience (MX).

# Contributing

We use GitHub as a collaboration platform for the development of the OSCAL models. Within the OSCAL GitHub repository you will find:
