We are excited that you want to contribute to the OSCAL project. We are striving to provide a collaborative environment for professionals to contribute to the project's goals and objectives. A primary focus of this project is to improve security assessment efficiency, accuracy, and consistency on the basis of real-world experience with the technology used in this space. The language we develop must be well-defined and easy to use for both human and machine-readable formats, improving both the User Experience (UX) and the Machine Experience (MX).

# Contributing

We use GitHub as a collaboration platform for the development of the OSCAL models. Within the OSCAL GitHub repository you will find:

- A [set of issues](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) for which we need your help. Feel free to pick from this list, or [reach out to us](/contact/) about any other ideas you might have.
- [Guidelines](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on contributing to this project.
- A [project board](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/projects) that shows the issues the team is currently working on.
