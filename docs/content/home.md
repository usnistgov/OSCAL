  content: OSCAL provides standard data formats for automation of systems security assessments and continuous monitoring.

tagline: A “Standard for Standards” for Automating Security Assessment & Continuous Monitoring
intro: |
  NIST is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) "standard for standards". It consistes of a set of models expressed in standard notations (XML, JSON), offering machine-readable representations of information pertaining to the publication, implementation, and assessment of security controls. OSCAL is being developed through a collaborative approach with the public. It is designed to improve system security planning, assessment, and monitoring, with a technology that is both user- and developer-friendly.
  
  The [OSCAL GitHub repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL) holds the current OSCAL schemas, examples, documentation source files, and other resources. The NIST team welcomes public contributions to this project. If you are interested in contributing, please [contact us](/getinvolved/) on how to get started.
