An OSCAL catalog is a set of closely related OSCAL controls. The catalog for NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4 defines all NIST SP 800-53 controls. There would be a separate catalog for the controls from ISO 27002. An OSCAL catalog may simply define controls, or it may also organize those controls. Sections can be defined to partition a catalog, with each section containing one or more references to controls or control groups. A group references related controls or control groups.
