The OSCAL assessment layer provides models for describing how an assessment is planned and performed. 

The OSCAL models comprising the assessment layer are:

1. An **[Assessment Plan model](assessment-plan/)**, which represents the __planning__ of a periodic or continuous assessment.

1. One or more assessment execution models to be defined and developed as part of [OSCAL 2.0](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/milestones). 

The assessment plan and execution models are designed to work together. They enable automated testing as well as expedited manual activities. These models are intended to be used in the context of a specific system.

The OSCAL assessment layer is part of the OSCAL [architecture](/learnmore/architecture/).
