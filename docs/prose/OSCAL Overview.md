# OSCAL Overview
This is an overview of the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL). It explains why OSCAL is needed, who will benefit from the OSCAL work, what the OSCAL team has been working on, what the major challenges are in the OSCAL work, and what the future plans are for the OSCAL project.

## Terminology

Before discussing OSCAL, it is important to define three key OSCAL terms:
 * *Control*: A safeguard or countermeasure designed to satisfy a set of defined security and/or privacy requirements. While this is based on the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 definition of "control", in the context of OSCAL it refers to a similar kind of requirement from a control catalog. 
 * *Catalog*: A set of security control definitions. Examples include the hundreds of controls in NIST SP 800-53, the 100+ controls in ISO 27002, and the practices in COBIT 5. 
 * *Profile*: A set of security requirements; also called a baseline or overlay. Examples include the control baselines in NIST SP 800-53, the FedRAMP baselines, and the PCI DSS requirements. A profile is basically selecting a set of security requirements from one or more control catalogs.

## Major challenges in security controls assessment

OSCAL is attempting to address a number of challenges around security controls and security controls assessment. The core challenge, and one of the primary reasons for creating OSCAL, is that concepts like security controls and profiles are represented today largely in proprietary ways. In many cases they are written in prose documents that are imprecise, lead to differences in interpretation, and are not machine-readable, meaning that the prose instructions require someone to do data entry into a tool in order for the tool to use the information. 

Organizations are also struggling with information systems that have many different components, and some components require the use of different profiles per component, which is commonly the case with cloud environments. Also, the cloud environments can be multitenant or have mixed ownership of components. We need to be able to assess the security of these systems against a number of requirements, owners, etc.—to do that simultaneously and provide these views to stakeholders. 

On top of that there are situations where a single system needs to support multiple regulatory frameworks. For example, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is a federal agency (Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and NIST Cybersecurity Framework requirements) and a healthcare institution (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements) that has credit card transactions (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)). There is no shortage of requirements for some organizations that have multiple regulatory frameworks. 

Assessing all these security controls is extremely complex. Because of that complexity, it’s largely a manual process today. The OSCAL project is trying to change that. 

## The purpose of OSCAL

OSCAL is an attempt to standardize how security controls are represented, how a control implementation for a given system is represented, and how that information is best used and reports generated in a standardized way that can be used by both humans and machines. That means formats are needed that can be generated by machines for communicating with other machines, but can also easily be reformatted so humans can read the information. By standardizing the representation of this information, OSCAL information can be interoperable by having a well-defined specification with information that’s going to be used, imported, and used interoperably for security control assessments. The goal is to keep OSCAL as simple as possible and provide extensive automation for tools to use.

## OSCAL components and high-level architecture

The plans for OSCAL involve seven components, as depicted in the following diagram:

![OSCAL layers](/docs/graphics/oscal-layers.png "OSCAL Layer Diagram")

Here are the current definitions for each component. As the project progresses, these definitions may evolve. They are included here to indicate the overall body of work for OSCAL and not the finalized details of each component.  
 * *Catalog*: Defines a set of security controls (e.g., NIST SP 800-53 Appendix F); may also define objectives and methods for assessing the controls (e.g., NIST SP 800-53A). Combining assessment objectives and methods with security controls has been done because some control catalog formats, such as COBIT 5, address assessment information directly. Others have it separately, like 800-53A. Including assessment objectives within the OSCAL catalog model simplifies the entire OSCAL operational model.
 * *Profile*: Defines a set of security requirements, where meeting each requirement necessitates implementing one or more security controls. The profile format will allow for selecting security controls using a number of different mechanisms as well as tailoring those controls (e.g., assigning parameter values, modifying requirements). A profile can include controls from more than one catalog, so an organization could have a single profile that references controls from several catalogs.
 * *Implementation*: Defines how each profile item is implemented. This can represent a machine-readable system security plan in OSCAL format. It will also support transforms from the machine-readable form to a human-readable version.
 * *Assessment*: Describes how the system assessment is to be performed.
 * *Assessment Results*: Records the findings of the assessment.
 * *Metrics*: Defines metrics and measurements for understanding the effectiveness of the system’s security. 
 * *Mechanism*: Describes methods used to monitor the system’s current security state (e.g., Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)). 
 
## OSCAL users

The initial OSCAL work encompasses the catalog and profile components. There are several types of users who should benefit from OSCAL catalogs and profiles. They include the following producers of OSCAL catalogs, profiles, and/or tools:
 * *Catalog maintainers*: publishing catalogs into OSCAL format (e.g., NIST, ISO, ISACA)
 * *Standard profile maintainers*: profiles in OSCAL format used by many organizations consuming OSCAL catalogs (e.g., NIST, FedRAMP)
 * *Custom profile maintainers*: developing new profiles or customizing existing profiles for organization-specific use (e.g., cloud service providers, integrators)
 * *Tool vendors*: creating tools that use OSCAL to support risk assessment, continuous monitoring, compliance reporting, and other purposes
There are probably additional types of producers who would also use OSCAL.

Standardized OSCAL catalog and profile models should also be beneficial to several types of OSCAL consumers:
 * *Operations personnel*: rapidly verify that systems comply with organizational security requirements
 * *Security and privacy personnel*: automatically identify problems and address them quickly before loss or damage occur; for example, a profile could be used to identify incorrect parameter values that are weakening security
 * *Auditors/assessors*: perform audits/assessments on demand with minimal effort
 * *Policy personnel*: identify systemic problems that necessitate changes to organization security policy

## The relationship between the OSCAL catalog and profile models

To understand the relationship between the OSCAL catalog and profile models, consider the trivial conceptual example in the figure below. This example represents the NIST SP 800-53 low baseline. The catalog defines the possible security controls within the scope of NIST SP 800-53. The profile indicates which security controls from the catalog are required to be compliant with the low baseline. Using OSCAL formats for the catalog and profile makes the mappings between the catalog and the profile explicit and machine readable. 

![trivial_example](/docs/graphics/profile-catalog-mapping-trivial-example.png "Trivial Example of Profile and Catalog Mapping")

OSCAL provides a standarized, machine-readable profile with clear semantics. OSCAL allows profiles to be generated using the same interoperable format regardless of the underlying catalogs that are being used, like ISO 27001/2 and COBIT 5.

## OSCAL deliverables

The OSCAL project is producing several types of deliverables, including the following:
 * *XML schemas* for the OSCAL component models  
 * *Schematron definitions*, which are basically an extension of the XML schemas that provide more validation capabilities
 * *XSL templates* that allow production of human-readable versions out of OSCAL XML. It will be easy to convert an OSCAL XML catalog into a human-readable form. For right now we are supporting HTML, and we are working on other formats to produce PDFs, etc. We want to be able to leverage a similar kind of approach with our schemas so we can produce specification documents directly out of the schemas we’re producing. 
 * *CSS*, so that people who are developing catalogs and profiles using XML tools can use CSS for data entry. This makes the interface much more usable. 
 * A *prose OSCAL specification*. It will define the OSCAL component models; capture the operational model of how to use OSCAL, and explain how you can convert existing content (catalogs, profiles, etc.) into OSCAL formats.
 
All deliverables will be posted to the OSCAL GitHub repository. The repository also contains README files that explain what’s on the repository, how to use it, how the repository is organized, etc.

## Long-term goal for OSCAL

The long-term goal for OSCAL is to have OSCAL-enabled tools and OSCAL-formatted content widely available. This will significantly increase the degree of automation available for assessment processes. OSCAL use is intended to enable all of the following:
 * A large decrease in assessment-related labor
 * The ability to assess a system’s security much more often, ideally continuously
 * The ability to assess a system’s compliance with several sets of requirements simultaneously 
 * The consistent performance of assessments, regardless of system type, assessor, etc.
