        <p>Each IT goal presents an implicit link to an IT goal specified elsewhere in COBITS (the
            <q>Goals Cascade</q>). Here, references to IT goals are indicated by a two-digit numeric
          identifier (01-17) and a title, and glossed with a brief statement, <q>Metrics</q>. These
          are captured inside the <code>enhancement</code> as <code>prop with
          @class='number'</code>, <code>title</code> and <code>stmt with
          @class='metrics'</code>.</p>
        <p>The fact that this is an IT-related goal (as opposed to any other type) is captured by
          including a property <code>prop with @class='scope'</code> with the value
          <code>IT</code>.</p>
      </stmt>
      <stmt class="remarks">
        <p>The control enhancement used to describe this is the same as is used for (rows in) the
          next table, the process-related goal table. Note however that the IT-related goals (as
          indicated by the <code>scope</code> property) are implicit cross-links to elsewhere in
          COBIT 5.</p>

      <stmt class="concept">
        <p>Like IT-related goals, each process-related goal has a number, title and <q>Metrics</q>
          section. In this case, however, the <q>scope</q> property (<code>prop</code> with
            <code>@class</code>='scope') has the value <code>process</code>.</p>

      <prop class="target">enhancement with @class='raci_index' inside 'practice' enhancement</prop>
      <stmt class="concept">
        <p>In COBIT 5, the RACI index is presented at the level of the process (control). Mapped to
          OSCAL, this table's rows are allocated instead to the appropriate control enhancement
            (<q>practice</q>) to which they belong.</p>
        <p>The RACI index enhancement presents a simple list of properties, each one naming a party
          designated for RACI indexing. The properties must have <code>@class</code> values of
            <code>responsible</code>, <code>accountable</code>, <code>consulted</code> or
            <code>informed</code> (exclusively of one another). More than one property is expected
          to have any of these although guidelines suggest there should be only a single party
          marked as <code>accountable</code>.</p>
        <p>RACI tables for controls and across control sets and families can be constructed from
          these values.</p>

      <stmt class="remarks">
        <p>Note that according to COBIT (p. 26) not all practice inputs are represented explicitly,
          but only those that are specific to particular practices. So if a practice has an input
          due to another practice having <q>all</q> or <q>all EDM</q> as an output (for example),
          such an input is not listed. Only inputs designated for this particular control (practice)
          are indicated.</p>

          inputs can be detected by query.</p>
