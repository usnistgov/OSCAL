# OSCAL schema documentation

This subdirectory contains [documentation, in OSCAL XML format](oscal-oscal.xml), of the OSCAL schema and related resources such as Schematron constraint sets.

See an [OSCAL Tag Library](oscal-tag-library.md) (element definitions) in this subdirectory, produced from that file. Currently, only elements are described; TBD are attribute definitions along with more background and perhaps examples.

The XML also serves as an example of OSCAL - but for more correct or realistic examples with richer semantics, see [subdirectories under 'working'](../..), including [NIST SP800-53](../../SP800-53), [ISO 27002](../../ISO-27002), and [COBIT 5](../../COBIT5).

The publication version of the OSCAL schema may be found in the [lib/XSD](../../lib/XSD) directory as file [oscal-documented.xsd](../../lib/XSD/oscal-documented.xsd). This file is produced via an automated process [as described there](../../lib/XSD/readme.md).
