        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment:
            organization-defined personnel or roles]: 1. An access control policy that addresses
            purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
            organizational entities, and compliance; and 2. Procedures to facilitate the
            implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls; and b.
            Reviews and updates the current: 1. Access control policy [Assignment:
            organization-defined frequency]; and 2. Access control procedures [Assignment:
            organization-defined frequency]. Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the
            establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected
            security controls and control enhancements in the AC family. Policy and procedures
            reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies,
            standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
            level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
            policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for
            organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the
            complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
            security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The
            organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and
            procedures. Related control: PM-9. Control Enhancements: None. References: NIST Special

        <Control_name>ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT</Control_name>
        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Identifies and selects the following types of information
            system accounts to support organizational missions/business functions: [Assignment:
            organization-defined information system account types]; b. Assigns account managers for
            information system accounts; c. Establishes conditions for group and role membership; d.
            Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and
            access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each
            account; e. Requires approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
            for requests to create information system accounts; f. Creates, enables, modifies,
            disables, and removes information system accounts in accordance with [Assignment:
            organization-defined procedures or conditions]; g. Monitors the use of, information
            system accounts; h. Notifies account managers: 1. When accounts are no longer required;
            2. When users are terminated or transferred; and 3. When individual information system
            usage or need-to-know changes; i. Authorizes access to the information system based on:
            1. A valid access authorization; 2. Intended system usage; and 3. Other attributes as
            required by the organization or associated missions/business functions; j. Reviews
            accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment:
            organization-defined frequency]; and k. Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group
            account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.
            Supplemental Guidance: Information system account types include individual, shared,
            group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and
            service. Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by
            organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the
            information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements
            in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative
            privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate
            organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or chief
            information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged
            access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by
            account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for
            authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and
            point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider
            system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and
            mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements,
            remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could
            affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts
            intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of
            normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts
            without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish
            emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account
            activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account
            authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with
            infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by
            organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available
            and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or
            deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or
            temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or
            terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.

        <Control_desc>The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to
            information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.
            Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies,
            role-based policies, attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g.,
            access control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) control access between
            active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and
            passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, domains) in information
            systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information system level and
            recognizing that information systems can host many applications and services in support
            of organizational missions and business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can
            also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information
            security. Related controls: AC-2, AC-4, AC-5, AC-6, AC-16, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20,

        <Control_desc>The information system: a. Enforces a limit of [Assignment:
            organization-defined number] consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a
            [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and b. Automatically [Selection: locks
            the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; locks the
            account/node until released by an administrator; delays next logon prompt according to
            [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the maximum number of
            unsuccessful attempts is exceeded. Supplemental Guidance: This control applies
            regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection. Due to the
            potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by information systems are
            usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time period
            established by organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may choose
            to employ different algorithms for different information system components based on the
            capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be
            implemented at both the operating system and the application levels. Related controls:

            Users are accessing a U.S. Government information system; 2. Information system usage
            may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit; 3. Unauthorized use of the information
            system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and 4. Use of the

            Guidance: System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners
            displayed before individuals log in to information systems. System use notifications are
            used only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when
            such human interfaces do not exist. Organizations consider system use notification
            messages/banners displayed in multiple languages based on specific organizational needs
            and the demographics of information system users. Organizations also consult with the
            Office of the General Counsel for legal review and approval of warning banner content.

        <Control_name>PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION</Control_name>
        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined user
            actions] that can be performed on the information system without identification or
            authentication consistent with organizational missions/business functions; and b.
            Documents and provides supporting rationale in the security plan for the information
            system, user actions not requiring identification or authentication. Supplemental
            Guidance: This control addresses situations in which organizations determine that no
            identification or authentication is required in organizational information systems.
            Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or
            authentication including, for example, when individuals access public websites or other
            publicly accessible federal information systems, when individuals use mobile phones to
            receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations also identify actions that
            normally require identification or authentication but may under certain circumstances
            (e.g., emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed.
            Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that
            commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or
            unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and
            authentication have already occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations
            where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide
            that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational information
            systems without identification and authentication and thus, the values for assignment
            statements can be none. Related controls: CP-2, IA-2. Control Enhancements: None. (1)

        <Control_name>REMOTE ACCESS</Control_name>
        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Establishes and documents usage restrictions,
            configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of
            remote access allowed; and b. Authorizes remote access to the information system prior
            to allowing such connections. Supplemental Guidance: Remote access is access to
            organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users)
            communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods
            include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ
            encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over
            remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote;
            however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls
            (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity
            protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively
            treat such connections as internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external
            networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections.
            Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately
            monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply
            to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public
            access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without
            specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations may use
            interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such
            agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote
            connections is addressed in AC-3. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20,

            radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols
            (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.

        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Establishes usage restrictions, configuration
            requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for
            organization-controlled mobile devices; and b. Authorizes the connection of mobile
            devices to organizational information systems. Supplemental Guidance: A mobile device is
            a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried
            by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g.,
            wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii) possesses local, non- removable or
            removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices
            may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the
            device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data
            with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets. Mobile
            devices are typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually in
            close proximity to the individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending
            upon on the form factor and size of the device. The processing, storage, and
            transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of
            desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due to
            the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and
            capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of
            such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices
            include, for example, configuration management, device identification and
            authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code
            detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection
            software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary
            operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling
            unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the
            need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in
            this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in
            other security controls in the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as
            starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring
            process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the requirements articulated by the
            security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses mobile
            devices that are not organization-controlled. Related controls: AC-3, AC-7, AC-18,

        <Control_name>USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS</Control_name>
        <Control_desc>The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust
            relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining
            external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to: a. Access the
            information system from external information systems; and b. Process, store, or transmit
            organization-controlled information using external information systems. Supplemental
            Guidance: External information systems are information systems or components of
            information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by
            organizations and for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and
            authority over the application of required security controls or the assessment of
            control effectiveness. External information systems include, for example: (i) personally
            owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets,
            personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices
            resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention
            centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by
            nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not
            owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of organizations.
            This control also addresses the use of external information systems for the processing,
            storage, or transmission of organizational information, including, for example,
            accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or
            software as a service) from organizational information systems. For some external
            information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal agencies,
            including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that
            have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may
            be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within
            these organizations would not be considered external. These situations occur when, for
            example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit)
            established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or
            when such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders,
            directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational
            personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational
            information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules of
            behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on
            authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending
            upon the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose
            to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal
            governments. This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to
            access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g., individuals
            accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and
            conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational
            security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types of
            applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems from external
            information systems; and the highest security category of information that can be
            processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and
            conditions with the owners of external information systems cannot be established,
            organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external
            systems. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-3, PL-4, SA-9. References: FIPS

            reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies,
            standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
            level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The

        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Determines that the information system is capable of
            auditing the following events: [Assignment: organization-defined auditable events]; b.
            Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring
            audit- related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of
            auditable events; c. Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be
            adequate to support after- the-fact investigations of security incidents; and d.
            Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system:
            [Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events
            defined in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for
            each identified event]. Supplemental Guidance: An event is any observable occurrence in
            an organizational information system. Organizations identify audit events as those
            events which are significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the
            environments in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit
            needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed
            accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential
            usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events,
            organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be
            implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this
            control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a
            given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information systems
            must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but
            not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential
            burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including the need for auditable
            events, may be referenced in other security controls and control enhancements.
            Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal
            laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records
            can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as
            information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a
            critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root
            causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the
            auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed,
            transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple
            organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented architectures. Related

            stamps generated by the information system include date and time. Time is commonly
            expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean
            Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements
            refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference
            clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens
            of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for different
            system components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such
            as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the
            mechanisms used to support those capabilities. Related controls: AU-3, AU-12.

            categories of audit records relative to such types of actions and standard response
            processes for each type of action. The National Archives and Records Administration

            extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and

            and d. Provides the results of the security control assessment to [Assignment:
            organization-defined individuals or roles]. Supplemental Guidance: Organizations assess
            security controls in organizational information systems and the environments in which
            those systems operate as part of: (i) initial and ongoing security authorizations; (ii)
            FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) system development life
            cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security is built
            into organizational information systems; (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early
            in the development process; (iii) provide essential information needed to make
            risk-based decisions as part of security authorization processes; and (iv) ensure
            compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the
            implemented security controls from Appendix F (main catalog) and Appendix G (Program
            Management controls) as documented in System Security Plans and Information Security
            Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as
            vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of
            information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document
            assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to
            determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls
            are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with
            respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security
            controls at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those
            activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes. Security
            assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of
            assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security
            authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing official
            designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can
            use assessment results from the following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information
            system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii) system development life
            cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current,
            relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the
            appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment results
            can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be
            supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations
            and in accordance with OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during
            continuous monitoring. Organizations establish the frequency for ongoing security
            control assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies.
            Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability
            mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities such as

        <Control_desc>The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [Assignment:
            organization-defined level of independence] to conduct security control assessments.
            Supplemental Guidance: Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or
            groups who conduct impartial assessments of organizational information systems.
            Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of
            interest with regard to the development, operation, or management of the organizational
            information systems under assessment or to the determination of security control
            effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual or
            conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted;
            (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations
            they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in positions of advocacy for the
            organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be obtained from
            elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private sector entities
            outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of
            independence based on the security categories of information systems and/or the ultimate
            risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing
            officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient
            assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based
            decisions. This includes determining whether contracted security assessment services
            have sufficient independence, for example, when information system owners are not
            directly involved in contracting processes or cannot unduly influence the impartiality
            of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations, for example, when
            organizations that own the information systems are small or organizational structures
            require that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental,
            operational, or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes
            can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed
            by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and
            reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed for
            purposes other than direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed by
            assessors with sufficient independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions,
            thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments.</Control_desc>

            Interconnection Security Agreements [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
            Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to dedicated connections between information
            systems (i.e., system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory,
            user-controlled connections such as email and website browsing. Organizations carefully
            consider the risks that may be introduced when information systems are connected to
            other systems with different security requirements and security controls, both within
            organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials determine the risk
            associated with information system connections and the appropriate controls employed. If
            interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, organizations do not need to
            develop Interconnection Security Agreements. Instead, organizations can describe the
            interface characteristics between those interconnecting systems in their respective
            security plans. If interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within
            the same organization, organizations can either develop Interconnection Security
            Agreements or describe the interface characteristics between systems in the security
            plans for the respective systems. Organizations may also incorporate Interconnection
            Security Agreement information into formal contracts, especially for interconnections
            established between federal agencies and nonfederal (i.e., private sector)
            organizations. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same
            networks. For certain technologies (e.g., space, unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical
            devices), there may be specialized connections in place during preoperational testing.
            Such connections may require Interconnection Security Agreements and be subject to

        <Control_name>SECURITY AUTHORIZATION</Control_name>
        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the
            authorizing official for the information system; b. Ensures that the authorizing
            official authorizes the information system for processing before commencing operations;
            and c. Updates the security authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
            Supplemental Guidance: Security authorizations are official management decisions,
            conveyed through authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or
            executives (i.e., authorizing officials) to authorize operation of information systems
            and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
            other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of agreed-upon security
            controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational
            information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business operations
            supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an inherently federal
            responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through
            the security authorization process, authorizing officials assume responsibility and are
            accountable for security risks associated with the operation and use of organizational
            information systems. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in positions with levels of
            authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information
            security-related risks. OMB policy requires that organizations conduct ongoing
            authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous monitoring programs.
            Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization requirements, so
            separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of
            comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in
            authorization packages (i.e., security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of
            action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials
            and information system owners with an up-to-date status of the security state of
            organizational information systems and environments of operation. To reduce the
            administrative cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results
            of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for
            rendering reauthorization decisions. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10. Control

        <Control_desc>The organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a
            continuous monitoring program that includes: a. Establishment of [Assignment:
            organization-defined metrics] to be monitored; b. Establishment of [Assignment:

            assessments in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy; d.
            Ongoing security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics in accordance with
            the organizational continuous monitoring strategy; e. Correlation and analysis of
            security-related information generated by assessments and monitoring; f. Response

            Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to [Assignment:
            organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
            Supplemental Guidance: Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of
            threats, vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk
            management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations
            assess/analyze security controls and information security-related risks at a frequency
            sufficient to support organizational risk-based decisions. The results of continuous
            monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations.
            Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain the security
            authorizations of information systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic
            environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats,
            vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security-related information on a
            continuing basis through reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the
            capability to make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including
            ongoing security authorization decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to
            security authorization packages, hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other
            system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs
            are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant,
            and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security
            categories of information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4, PM-6,

            Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed and agreed-upon sets of
            specifications for information systems or configuration items within those systems.
            Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes to
            information systems. Baseline configurations include information about information
            system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook
            computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and
            patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration
            settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those components
            within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating
            new baselines as organizational information systems change over time. Baseline
            configurations of information systems reflect the current enterprise architecture.

            Managers, and Information System Security Engineers) conduct security impact analyses.
            Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary skills/technical
            expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security

            and d. Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with
            organizational policies and procedures. Supplemental Guidance: Configuration settings
            are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or firmware
            components of the information system that affect the security posture and/or
            functionality of the system. Information technology products for which security- related
            configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers
            (e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name),
            workstations, input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network
            components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access
            points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications.
            Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of
            information systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security control
            requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: (i) registry settings;
            (ii) account, file, directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions,
            ports, protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish
            organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for
            information systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration
            baseline. Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration
            checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical
            implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that
            stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology
            platforms/products and instructions for configuring those information system components
            to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a
            variety of organizations including, for example, information technology product
            developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and
            other organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations
            include the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the
            implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content
            Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common
            Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and
            control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration

            prohibited or restricted functions, ports, protocols, and/or services]. Supplemental
            Guidance: Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some
            of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support
            essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is
            sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system
            components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one
            component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single
            function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations
            review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components
            of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for
            elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and
            file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and
            logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper
            Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of
            devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations
            can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and
            end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to
            identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.

            Guidance: Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system component
            inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. In such
            situations, organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific
            information required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system
            association, information system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective
            accountability of information system components includes, for example, hardware
            inventory specifications, software license information, software version numbers,
            component owners, and for networked components or devices, machine names and network
            addresses. Inventory specifications include, for example, manufacturer, device type,
            model, serial number, and physical location. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6, PM-5.

        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Develops a contingency plan for the information system
            that: 1. Identifies essential missions and business functions and associated contingency
            requirements; 2. Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics; 3.
            Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact
            information; 4. Addresses maintaining essential missions and business functions despite
            an information system disruption, compromise, or failure; 5. Addresses eventual, full
            information system restoration without deterioration of the security safeguards
            originally planned and implemented; and 6. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment:
            organization-defined personnel or roles]; b. Distributes copies of the contingency plan
            to [Assignment: organization-defined key contingency personnel (identified by name
            and/or by role) and organizational elements]; c. Coordinates contingency planning
            activities with incident handling activities; d. Reviews the contingency plan for the
            information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; e. Updates the
            contingency plan to address changes to the organization, information system, or
            environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan
            implementation, execution, or testing; f. Communicates contingency plan changes to
            [Assignment: organization-defined key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or
            by role) and organizational elements]; and g. Protects the contingency plan from
            unauthorized disclosure and modification. Supplemental Guidance: Contingency planning
            for information systems is part of an overall organizational program for achieving
            continuity of operations for mission/business functions. Contingency planning addresses
            both information system restoration and implementation of alternative mission/business
            processes when systems are compromised. The effectiveness of contingency planning is
            maximized by considering such planning throughout the phases of the system development
            life cycle. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware
            development can be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency.
            Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational
            information systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level
            of continuity of operations desired. Information system recovery objectives reflect
            applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and
            guidelines. In addition to information system availability, contingency plans also
            address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission and/or
            business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or
            integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for
            example, orderly/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a manual
            mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are
            under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident handling
            activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning activities
            are in place and activated in the event of a security incident. Related controls: AC-14,

            personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such
            training. For example, regular users may only need to know when and where to report for
            duty during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; system
            administrators may require additional training on how to set up information systems at

            where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network
            access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on
            behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network connections (i.e.,
            nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves
            communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include
            local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of encrypted virtual
            private networks (VPNs) for network connections between organization- controlled
            endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks
            from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information
            traversing the network. Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication
            requirements in this control by complying with the requirements in Homeland Security
            Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the specific organizational implementation
            plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to
            achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: (i) something you know (e.g.,
            password, personal identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g.,
            cryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g.,
            biometric). Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems
            gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or
            challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal
            Identity Verification card and the DoD common access card. In addition to identifying
            and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations
            also employ identification and authentication mechanisms at the application level, when
            necessary, to provide increased information security. Identification and authentication
            requirements for other than organizational users are described in IA-8. Related

            Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control (MAC), Internet
            protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of individual
            identifiers is not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and
            anonymous accounts). Typically, individual identifiers are the user names of the
            information system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the
            account management activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control
            also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with information system
            accounts (e.g., identifiers used in physical security control databases accessed by
            badge reader systems for access to information systems). Preventing reuse of identifiers
            implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, or device
            identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices. Related controls: AC-2,

            Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator
            distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking
            authenticators; e. Changing default content of authenticators prior to information
            system installation; f. Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse
            conditions for authenticators; g. Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment:
            organization-defined time period by authenticator type]; h. Protecting authenticator
            content from unauthorized disclosure and modification; i. Requiring individuals to take,
            and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect authenticators;
            and j. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts
            changes. Supplemental Guidance: Individual authenticators include, for example,
            passwords, tokens, biometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator
            content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements
            about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases, developers
            ship information system components with factory default authentication credentials to
            allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are
            often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The
            requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or
            PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and
            SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g.,
            passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed
            passwords accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support
            individual authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions
            for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password
            length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one-time
            tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric
            authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include,
            for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing
            individual authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised
            authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when
            no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote
            maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords.

            for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password. Supplemental
            Guidance: This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of
            individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a similar
            manner, when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators. This control enhancement
            does not apply when passwords are used to unlock hardware authenticators (e.g., Personal
            Identity Verification cards). The implementation of such password mechanisms may not
            meet all of the requirements in the enhancement. Encrypted representations of passwords
            include, for example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way cryptographic hashes
            of passwords. The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required

            unauthorized individuals. Supplemental Guidance: The feedback from information systems
            does not provide information that would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise
            authentication mechanisms. For some types of information systems or system components,
            for example, desktops/notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (often
            referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems or
            components, for example, mobile devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat may be less
            significant, and may need to be balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic
            input errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the
            authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring the feedback of authentication
            information includes, for example, displaying asterisks when users type passwords into
            input devices, or displaying feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it.

            [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. Supplemental Guidance: This control
            addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of
            selected security controls and control enhancements in the IR family. Policy and
            procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
            policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the
            organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures
            unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security
            policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
            reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be
            established for the security program in general and for particular information systems,

            of organizational personnel to ensure the appropriate content and level of detail is
            included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know who to call
            or how to recognize an incident on the information system; system administrators may
            require additional training on how to handle/remediate incidents; and incident
            responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery,
            and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification
            and reporting of suspicious activities, both from external and internal sources. Related

        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Implements an incident handling capability for security
            incidents that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication,
            and recovery; b. Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning
            activities; and c. Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling
            activities into incident response procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and
            implements the resulting changes accordingly. Supplemental Guidance: Organizations
            recognize that incident response capability is dependent on the capabilities of
            organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being supported by
            those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the
            definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and information
            systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources
            including, for example, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access
            monitoring, user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective
            incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities
            including, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing
            officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal
            departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive

            [Assignment: organization-defined authorities]. Supplemental Guidance: The intent of
            this control is to address both specific incident reporting requirements within an
            organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for federal agencies and
            their subordinate organizations. Suspected security incidents include, for example, the
            receipt of suspicious email communications that can potentially contain malicious code.
            The types of security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and
            the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
            directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Current federal policy
            requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically exempted from such requirements)
            report security incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team
            (US-CERT) within specified time frames designated in the US-CERT Concept of Operations

            organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident response.
            Organizational missions, business functions, strategies, goals, and objectives for
            incident response help to determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As
            part of a comprehensive incident response capability, organizations consider the

            physically present at the information system or information system component and not
            communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used in the
            establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access
            requirements in IA-2. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators that are
            resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators
            include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a

            software maintenance on organizational information systems, while PE-2 addresses
            physical access for individuals whose maintenance duties place them within the physical
            protection perimeter of the systems (e.g., custodial staff, physical plant maintenance
            personnel). Technical competence of supervising individuals relates to the maintenance
            performed on the information systems while having required access authorizations refers
            to maintenance on and near the systems. Individuals not previously identified as
            authorized maintenance personnel, such as information technology manufacturers, vendors,
            systems integrators, and consultants, may require privileged access to organizational
            information systems, for example, when required to conduct maintenance activities with
            little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, organizations may
            issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may be for

        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Sanitizes [Assignment: organization-defined information
            system media] prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for
            reuse using [Assignment: organization- defined sanitization techniques and procedures]
            in accordance with applicable federal and organizational standards and policies; and b.
            Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the
            security category or classification of the information. Supplemental Guidance: This
            control applies to all information system media, both digital and non- digital, subject
            to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include
            media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network
            components, and mobile devices. The sanitization process removes information from the
            media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization
            techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent
            the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or
            released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods
            recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied
            to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of
            approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed
            to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact
            on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of
            non-digital media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an
            otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document
            by obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to
            removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization
            process for media containing classified information. Related controls: MA-2, MA-4, RA-3,

            organization-defined information systems or system components] using [Assignment:
            organization-defined security safeguards]. Supplemental Guidance: Information system
            media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example,
            diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact
            disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and
            microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information storage
            capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers). In contrast to MP-2, which
            restricts user access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of media
            on information systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash drives or
            external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical
            safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, rules of behavior) to restrict the use of
            information system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable storage
            devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to
            certain external ports, or disabling/removing the ability to insert, read or write to
            such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only
            approved devices including, for example, devices provided by the organization, devices
            provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned.
            Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices based on the
            type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable storage devices,
            and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to
            such devices. Related controls: AC-19, PL-4. References: None. </Control_desc>

            Organizations determine the types of facility guards needed including, for example,
            professional physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff or
            information system users. Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks,
            combinations, and card readers. Safeguards for publicly accessible areas within
            organizational facilities include, for example, cameras, monitoring by guards, and
            isolating selected information systems and/or system components in secured areas.
            Physical access control systems comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
            directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The Federal Identity,
            Credential, and Access Management Program provides implementation guidance for identity,
            credential, and access management capabilities for physical access control systems.
            Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be
            procedural (e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility and when such
            access occurred), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a PIV card), or some
            combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior

        <Control_name>SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN</Control_name>
        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Develops a security plan for the information system that:
            1. Is consistent with the organization’s enterprise architecture; 2. Explicitly defines
            the authorization boundary for the system; 3. Describes the operational context of the
            information system in terms of missions and business processes; 4. Provides the security
            categorization of the information system including supporting rationale; 5. Describes
            the operational environment for the information system and relationships with or
            connections to other information systems; 6. Provides an overview of the security
            requirements for the system; 7. Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable; 8.
            Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements
            including a rationale for the tailoring and supplementation decisions; and 9. Is
            reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative prior to
            plan implementation; b. Distributes copies of the security plan and communicates
            subsequent changes to the plan to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
            c. Reviews the security plan for the information system [Assignment:
            organization-defined frequency]; d. Updates the plan to address changes to the
            information system/environment of operation or problems identified during plan
            implementation or security control assessments; and e. Protects the security plan from
            unauthorized disclosure and modification. Supplemental Guidance: Security plans relate
            security requirements to a set of security controls and control enhancements. Security
            plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and control enhancements
            meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of
            the specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans
            contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for
            assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a
            design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans
            and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets,
            individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended.
            Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in
            Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or to
            address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation
            (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential,
            and Access Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on developing
            overlays. Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of
            various documents including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make
            extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g.,
            design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be
            obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs
            and maintains security-related information in other established management/operational
            areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems
            engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed
            contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or
            by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those
            plans. Related controls: AC-2, AC-6, AC-14, AC-17, AC-20, CA-2, CA-3, CA-7, CM-9, CP-2,

        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Establishes and makes readily available to individuals
            requiring access to the information system, the rules that describe their
            responsibilities and expected behavior with regard to information and information system
            usage; b. Receives a signed acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that they
            have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing
            access to information and the information system; c. Reviews and updates the rules of
            behavior [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and d. Requires individuals who
            have signed a previous version of the rules of behavior to read and resign when the
            rules of behavior are revised/updated. Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement
            applies to organizational users. Organizations consider rules of behavior based on
            individual user roles and responsibilities, differentiating, for example, between rules
            that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules
            of behavior for some types of non-organizational users including, for example,
            individuals who simply receive data/information from federal information systems, is
            often not feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their
            interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior for both organizational and
            non-organizational users can also be established in AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4
            b. (the signed acknowledgment portion of this control) may be satisfied by the security
            awareness training and role-based security training programs conducted by organizations
            if such training includes rules of behavior. Organizations can use electronic signatures

            services, outsourced applications, and network and security management. Organizations
            explicitly include personnel security requirements in acquisition-related documents.
            Third-party providers may have personnel working at organizational facilities with
            credentials, badges, or information system privileges issued by organizations.
            Notifications of third-party personnel changes ensure appropriate termination of

            Ensures that the security categorization decision is reviewed and approved by the
            authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative. Supplemental
            Guidance: Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective
            security categorization decisions. Security categories describe the potential adverse
            impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals if
            organizational information and information systems are comprised through a loss of
            confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Organizations conduct the security
            categorization process as an organization-wide activity with the involvement of chief
            information officers, senior information security officers, information system owners,
            mission/business owners, and information owners/stewards. Organizations also consider
            the potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA
            PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential
            national-level adverse impacts. Security categorization processes carried out by
            organizations facilitate the development of inventories of information assets, and along

        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Conducts an assessment of risk, including the likelihood
            and magnitude of harm, from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,
            modification, or destruction of the information system and the information it processes,
            stores, or transmits; b. Documents risk assessment results in [Selection: security plan;
            risk assessment report; [Assignment: organization-defined document]]; c. Reviews risk
            assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; d. Disseminates risk
            assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; and e.
            Updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or whenever
            there are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation
            (including the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions
            that may impact the security state of the system. Supplemental Guidance: Clearly defined
            authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Risk
            assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to
            organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
            based on the operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also take into
            account risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating
            information systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational
            information systems, outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related
            E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal
            information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related
            information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access to
            federal information systems. Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be
            conducted at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level,
            mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any phase in the
            system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps
            in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security control selection,
            security control implementation, security control assessment, information system
            authorization, and security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control
            must be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to
            complete the first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play
            an important role in security control selection processes, particularly during the
            application of tailoring guidance, which includes security control supplementation.

            scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate
            parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for: 1. Enumerating
            platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations; 2. Formatting checklists and
            test procedures; and 3. Measuring vulnerability impact; c. Analyzes vulnerability scan
            reports and results from security control assessments; d. Remediates legitimate
            vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in accordance with an

            organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in
            other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies). Supplemental
            Guidance: Security categorization of information systems guides the frequency and
            comprehensiveness of vulnerability scans. Organizations determine the required
            vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential
            sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not
            overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require
            additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a
            hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a
            variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary
            analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i)
            scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services
            that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly
            configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations
            consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and
            Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment
            Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources
            for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and
            the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments
            such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which
            to scan. Organizations also consider using tools that express vulnerability impact by
            the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-4,

            having information security roles and responsibilities; and d. Integrates the
            organizational information security risk management process into system development life
            cycle activities. Supplemental Guidance: A well-defined system development life cycle
            provides the foundation for the successful development, implementation, and operation of
            organizational information systems. To apply the required security controls within the
            system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security,
            threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions/business
            functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly applied if
            individuals that design, code, and test information systems and system components
            (including information technology products) do not understand security. Therefore,
            organizations include qualified personnel, for example, chief information security
            officers, security architects, security engineers, and information system security
            officers in system development life cycle activities to ensure that security
            requirements are incorporated into organizational information systems. It is equally
            important that developers include individuals on the development team that possess the
            requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are
            effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training
            programs can help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities
            have the appropriate experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system
            development life cycle activities. The effective integration of security requirements
            into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security considerations
            are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that those considerations
            are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This process also
            facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise
            architecture, consistent with organizational risk management and information security
            strategies. Related controls: AT-3, PM-7, SA-8. Control Enhancements: None. References:

            strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms
            include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to direct attack, and resistance
            to tampering or bypass. Security assurance requirements include: (i) development
            processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development
            and assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security
            functionality has been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved.
            Security documentation requirements address all phases of the system development life
            cycle. Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed
            in terms of security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through
            the tailoring process. The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the
            specification of parameter values through the use of assignment and selection statements
            and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation information. Security
            documentation provides user and administrator guidance regarding the implementation and
            operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security documentation
            is based on the security category or classification level of the information system and
            the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions,
            or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the
            organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include
            organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports,
            protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system
            components, and information system services are defined in the same manner as such
            criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement. The Federal Acquisition
            Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information security requirements from FISMA.

        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Obtains administrator documentation for the information
            system, system component, or information system service that describes: 1. Secure
            configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component, or service; 2.
            Effective use and maintenance of security functions/mechanisms; and 3. Known
            vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative (i.e., privileged)
            functions; b. Obtains user documentation for the information system, system component,
            or information system service that describes: 1. User-accessible security
            functions/mechanisms and how to effectively use those security functions/mechanisms; 2.
            Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, or

            accordance with the risk management strategy; and e. Distributes documentation to
            [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]. Supplemental Guidance: This
            control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation and operation of
            security controls associated with information systems, system components, and
            information system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to
            determine the quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability to obtain
            needed documentation may occur, for example, due to the age of the information
            system/component or lack of support from developers and contractors. In those
            situations, organizations may need to recreate selected documentation if such
            documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of security
            controls. The level of protection provided for selected information system, component,
            or service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of
            the system. For example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons system or
            command and control system would typically require a higher level of protection than a
            routine administrative system. Documentation that addresses information system
            vulnerabilities may also require an increased level of protection. Secure operation of
            the information system, includes, for example, initially starting the system and
            resuming secure system operation after any lapse in system operation. Related controls:

        <Control_name>EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES</Control_name>
        <Control_desc>The organization: a. Requires that providers of external information system
            services comply with organizational information security requirements and employ
            [Assignment: organization-defined security controls] in accordance with applicable
            federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
            guidance; b. Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and
            responsibilities with regard to external information system services; and c. Employs
            [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques] to monitor
            security control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis.
            Supplemental Guidance: External information system services are services that are
            implemented outside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information
            systems. This includes services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational
            information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations using external
            service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting federal information or
            operating information systems on behalf of the federal government ensure that such
            providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies are required to
            meet. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety
            of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships,
            contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements,
            and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of
            external information system services remains with authorizing officials. For services
            external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and
            retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the potentially complex
            consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered.
            The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between
            organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust
            relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External information
            system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security
            roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements
            define expectations of performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes,
            and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of
            noncompliance. Related controls: CA-3, IR-7, PS-7. References: NIST Special Publication

            [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. Supplemental Guidance: This control
            addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of
            selected security controls and control enhancements in the SC family. Policy and
            procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
            policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the
            organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures
            unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security
            policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
            reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be
            established for the security program in general and for particular information systems,

            technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of denial of
            service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of
            packets to protect information system components on internal organizational networks
            from being directly affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity
            and bandwidth combined with service redundancy may also reduce the susceptibility to
            denial of service attacks. Related controls: SC-6, SC-7. References: None. </Control_desc>

        <Control_desc>The information system: a. Monitors and controls communications at the
            external boundary of the system and at key internal boundaries within the system; b.
            Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection:
            physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and c. Connects
            to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting
            of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security
            architecture. Supplemental Guidance: Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways,
            routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization
            systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a security architecture (e.g., routers
            protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected subnetworks).
            Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are
            referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within
            organizational information systems includes, for example, restricting external web
            traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external
            traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. Organizations consider the
            shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of
            security controls associated with the use of such services. Commercial
            telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated
            management systems shared by all attached commercial customers, and may also include
            third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services
            may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Related

            be performed using manual procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual
            procedures. Organizations define key management requirements in accordance with
            applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
            and guidance, specifying appropriate options, levels, and parameters. Organizations
            manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust anchors are in such trust stores.

            applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and
            standards. Supplemental Guidance: Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of
            security solutions including, for example, the protection of classified and Controlled
            Unclassified Information, the provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of
            information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances for

            be used to support random number generation and hash generation. Generally applicable
            cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved
            cryptography. This control does not impose any requirements on organizations to use
            cryptography. However, if cryptography is required based on the selection of other
            security controls, organizations define each type of cryptographic use and the type of

            This control enables external clients including, for example, remote Internet clients,
            to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances for the
            host/service name to network address resolution information obtained through the
            service. Information systems that provide name and address resolution services include,
            for example, domain name system (DNS) servers. Additional artifacts include, for
            example, DNS Security (DNSSEC) digital signatures and cryptographic keys. DNS resource
            records are examples of authoritative data. The means to indicate the security status of
            child zones includes, for example, the use of delegation signer resource records in the
            DNS. The DNS security controls reflect (and are referenced from) OMB Memorandum 08-23.

            services either performs this validation on its own, or has authenticated channels to
            trusted validation providers. Information systems that provide name and address
            resolution services for local clients include, for example, recursive resolving or
            caching domain name system (DNS) servers. DNS client resolvers either perform validation
            of DNSSEC signatures, or clients use authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that
            perform such validations. Information systems that use technologies other than the DNS

            SERVICE</Control_name>
        <Control_desc>The information systems that collectively provide name/address resolution
            service for an organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal/external role
            separation. Supplemental Guidance: Information systems that provide name and address
            resolution services include, for example, domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate
            single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two
            authoritative domain name system servers, one configured as the primary server and the
            other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations typically deploy
            the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not located in
            the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only
            process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from
            internal clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address
            resolution information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on
            external networks including the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access
            authoritative DNS servers in particular roles (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists).

        <Control_desc>The information system maintains a separate execution domain for each
            executing process. Supplemental Guidance: Information systems can maintain separate
            execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate
            address space. Each information system process has a distinct address space so that
            communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security
            functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process.
            Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for
            example, by implementing separate address spaces. This capability is available in most
            commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies. Related

            flaws; b. Tests software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for
            effectiveness and potential side effects before installation; c. Installs
            security-relevant software and firmware updates within [Assignment: organization-
            defined time period] of the release of the updates; and d. Incorporates flaw remediation
            into the organizational configuration management process. Supplemental Guidance:
            Organizations identify information systems affected by announced software flaws
            including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this
            information to designated organizational personnel with information security
            responsibilities. Security-relevant software updates include, for example, patches,
            service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations also address flaws
            discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response
            activities, and system error handling. Organizations take advantage of available
            resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and
            Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational information
            systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing configuration management
            processes, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and verified. Flaw
            remediation actions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining
            whether organizations follow US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability
            Alerts. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and
            firmware may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security
            category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of
            the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may
            require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree and type of
            testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration
            and also the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations,
            organizations may determine that the testing of software and/or firmware updates is not
            necessary or practical, for example, when implementing simple anti-virus signature
            updates. Organizations may also consider in testing decisions, whether security-relevant
            software or firmware updates are obtained from authorized sources with appropriate
            digital signatures. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3, CM-5, CM-8, MA-2, IR-4, RA-5,

            Updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available in
            accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures; c.
            Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to: 1. Perform periodic scans of the
            information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and real-time scans of
            files from external sources at [Selection (one or more); endpoint; network entry/exit
            points] as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with
            organizational security policy; and 2. [Selection (one or more): block malicious code;
            quarantine malicious code; send alert to administrator; [Assignment:

            the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the
            resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system. Supplemental
            Guidance: Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls,
            electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers,
            workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for
            example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded
            in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden
            files, or hidden in files using steganography. Malicious code can be transported by
            different means including, for example, web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail
            attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the
            exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms
            include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based
            technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the
            effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software
            integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In
            addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in
            custom-built software. This could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and
            other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational missions/business
            functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such
            code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including, for
            example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted
            procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not
            perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in
            response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For
            example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during
            periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions
            in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.

            based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible
            sources of information; f. Obtains legal opinion with regard to information system
            monitoring activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
            directives, policies, or regulations; and g. Provides [Assignment: or ganization-defined
            information system monitoring information] to [Assignment: organization-defined
            personnel or roles] [Selection (one or more): as needed; [Assignment:
            organization-defined frequency]]. Supplemental Guidance: Information system monitoring
            includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation
            of events occurring at the information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense
            and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events
            occurring within the information system. Organizations can monitor information systems,
            for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system
            aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The
            monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. Information system
            monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g.,
            intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection
            software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring
            software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected
            perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such
            devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7
            and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security
            can also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information
            collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of
            information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of
            interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses
            HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of organizational
            continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring
            serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network
            connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g.,
            local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device
            communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and
            remote connections can be either wired or wireless. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-8,

            situational awareness across the federal government. Security directives are issued by
            OMB or other designated organizations with the responsibility and authority to issue
            such directives. Compliance to security directives is essential due to the critical
            nature of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on
