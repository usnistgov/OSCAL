# OSCAL Metaschema

An OSCAL Metaschema defines the the information structures that define an OSCAL model in a format-neutral form. Documentation about the meaning (semantics) and use of a given metaschema structure is provided on the Metaschema [website].

OSCAL Metaschemas are used to generate other OSCAL artifacts based on the metaschema description. These artifacts include:

- XML and JSON schemas, or *data models*, which are derived from the metaschema and expressed as XSD and JSON Schema;
- Conversion scripts that can convert OSCAL content between the XML and JSON OSCAL formats, ensuring the resulting content is schema valid;
- XML and JSON [model documentation](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/docs/schemas/) for use on the [OSCAL website](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL).

Use of Metaschema modules in OSCAL allows us to maintain seamless and consistent support for multiple OSCAL model formats, including XML and JSON. More information is at the [Metaschema Information Modeling Framework documentation site](https://pages.nist.gov/metaschema/).
