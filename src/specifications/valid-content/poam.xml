            <p>The assessor's security automation platform analyzed all roles specific to the
                GoodRead Product Team, not those managed by the Office of Information Technology.
                The <code>IFA-GoodRead-SystemEnginer</code> role in their respective AwesomeCloud
                account permitted use of the following high-risk actions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>awesomecloud:auditlog:DeleteAccountAuditLog</li>
                <li>awesomecloud:secmon:AdministerConfigurations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both of these actions are overly permissive and not appropriate for the business
                function of the staff member assigned this role.</p>
