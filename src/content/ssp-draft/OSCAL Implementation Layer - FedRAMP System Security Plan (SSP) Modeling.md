# OSCAL Implementation Layer - FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP) Modeling
This defines the data fields to express a FedRAMP SSP in machine redable format. The intent is to translate this to XML and JSON for adoption as part of the Open OSCAL Implementation Layer specification.
This is part of the NIST OSCAL effort as covered by [Issue #246](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/246).

# User stories

1. As a system owner and/or administrator I am able to express my existing MS Word or PDF-based FedRAMP SSP in an OSCAL-compliant, machine readable format. 

1. As a FedRAMP reviewer, I am able to use tools to expedite the review of a FedRAMP SSP submitted in an OSCAL-compliant format through automated:
-- **validation of the information submitted;**
--- is all appropriate content provided?
 (i.e. every control has an implementation status? were any controls incorrectly omitted?; was the system owerner identified?)
--- does the content correlate? 
(i.e. if a control indicates inheritence, were details provided about the underlying system in the appropriate section?; if FIPS 140-2 validated modules are indicated, were the certificate numbers provided? If a role was specified for a control, was the role described in the appropriate section?)
--- can external references be validated? 
(i.e. can the indicated FIPS 140-2 validation certificate numbers be found in the NIST Labs Database; are all attachments and external references accessible?)
-- **review tracking;**
--- Has this control been reviewed?
--- Did the reviewer find the content to be fully compliant, partially compliant, or non-compliant?
--- What feedback does the reviewer have? 
(if not fully compliant, the reviewer must cite the nature of the partial- or non-compliance)
--- What is the disposition of cited partial- or non-compliance?

## FedRAMP SSP Overview
FedRAMP currently provides SSP templates in MS Word format. There are SSP templates for FedRAMP High, Moderate, and Low cloud service offerings, as well as a template for Low Impact (LI) SaaS Systems under FedRAMP Tailored.

Relevant Links:
* High: https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-SSP-High-Baseline-Template.docx
* Moderate: https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-SSP-Moderate-Baseline-Template.docx
* Low: https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-SSP-Low-Baseline-Template.docx
* LI-SaaS: https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/APPENDIX-B-FedRAMP-Tailored-LI-SaaS-Template.docx

The information requires for High, Moderate, and Low SSPs are identical from a data modeling perspective. The front-matter (Title page through chapter 12) of each is essentially identical, and contains a significant amount of structured data. The fundamental difference between these three SSP templates is the specific controls required in each baseline.

When complete, these templates include attachments and diagrams. Some attachments are also based on FedRAMP templates, such as for system inventory and the privacy impact analysis. Some of these attachments are highly structured and easily modled. Others are not. All are assessed and addressed following the core SSP content.

The structure of the FedRAMP Tailored for LI-SaaS template provides for a sub-set of the typical FedRAMP SSP data, as well as a place to capture assessment details in an attmept to keep that package lgiht-weight. Anything we model for the High/Moderate/Low SSP templates above will work for for the LI-SaaS template with the exception that much of the required content from these SSP templates becomes optional for the LI-SaaS template.

## Proto-model

The following applies to FedRAMP High, Moderate, and Low SSPs unless otherwise noted.



### Authoritative Control References
Points back to the specific authoritative control references, such as the FedRAMp Moderate baseline, or the NIST High baseline.
```yaml=    
# Indicates what control data should be referenced
# Cardinality: 1 or more
import: What OSCAL profile(s) or catalog(s) should be used as the source for control information?
    href: Where can it be found?
```


### Publication Characteristics

```yaml=
# High level "document" identification
# Cardinality: 1
publication: 
  publication_id: Unique document ID, generated by the publishing organization (for SSPs this is typically the CSP)
  publication_title: The title of the publication (typically "FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP) [High | Moderate | Low ] Baseline [CSP Name] [System Name]")
  publication_version: The CSP-assigned version number of this publication

## SSP Minimum Security Controls
Security controls are the main focus of OSCAL. The implementation layer control modeling is being addressed in a parallel effort as part of [Issue #217](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/217), with the modeling efforts found [HERE](https://hackmd.io/x43sK8IvSyOhW3no7fdh2w?view). That effort will be merged with this representation after each is developed separately

It is import each control traces back to the control requirement statements. Each control should trace to the most down-stream reference to it. This is especially important to ensure proper parameter values are established. 

For example AC-2 appears in the FedRAMP Moderate Profile, which references the NIST Moderate Profile, which in turn references the 800-53 catalog. This should point to the FedRAMP Moderate profile to ensure the FedRAMp parameter constraint in (j) is maintained.

```yaml=

## SSP Attachments

### Attachment 1: Information Security Policies and Procedures
- This is typically not structured information. 
- With the OSCAL SSP format, this will only exist as an entry in the &lt;attachments&gt; element that points to the external documents.
- This will continue to be handled only as an attachment. The content will not appear in the OSCAL SSP format at this time. 

### Attachment 2: User Guide
- This is typically not structured information. 
- With the OSCAL SSP format, this will only exist as an entry in the &lt;attachments&gt; element that points to the external documents.
- This will continue to be handled only as an attachment. The content will not appear in the OSCAL SSP format at this time. 

### Attachment 3: Digital Identity Worksheet
- This section is mostly guidance, which should be addressed by tooling external to the OSCAL SSP content.
-Table 15-2 Information System Name and Title, duplicates the content in Table 1-1, thus this content will be visually repeated here, rather than entered a second time. 
- The only data entered by a CSP is as follows:
```yaml=
    # Table 15-5
    # Cardinality: Exactly 1
    digital_identity_level: Level 1 (AAL1, IAL1, FAL1), 2 (AAL2, IAL2, FAL2) or 3 (AAL3, IAL3, FAL3)
```

### Attachment 4a: Privay Threshold Analysis
- Table 15-6 Privacy POC is simply another system role that will be addressed in the OSCAL SSP content with all other system roles (Approver, ISSO, Managemet POC, etc.)
- Table 15-7 Laws and Regulations and Table 15-8 Standards and Guidance are addressed in the OSCAL SSP content with the other Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Guidance. That content will have an attribute to flag it as privacy-related.
- This is structured information, and will appear in in the OSCAL SSP structure as follows:
```yaml=
    # Attachment 4: Privay Threshold Analysis
    # Cardinality 4
    # FedRAMP has four (4) yes/no questions, that must be present and answered. Answering any one "yes" requires the PIA
    pta_question: 
        question_text: The FedRAMP question
        response_text: The CSP's yes/no response
```

### Attachment 4b: Privacy Impact Assessment
- Attachment Table 1-1 Privacy POC is simply another system role that will be addressed in the OSCAL SSP content with all other system roles (Approver, ISSO, Managemet POC, etc.)
- Attachment Table 1-2 Laws and Regulations is addressed in the OSCAL SSP content with the other Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Guidance. That content will have an attribute to flag it as privacy-related. 

**Privacy Designation**
```yaml=
    # Attachment Section 2 
    # Cardinality 1
    privacy_designation: boolean ("yes" to indicate the vendor is willing to host privacy information in system. "no" to opt-out)
    
    # Attachment Table 3-1 PII Mapped to Components 
    # Cardinality 1 or more
    components: 
        # Cardinality 1
        component
        # Cardinality 1
        pii_contact: "yes" if the component stores, processes, or transmits PII; "no" otherwise.
        # Cardinality 1 or more
        pii_type: identify the type of PII stored, processed or transmitted by the component
        # Cardinality 1
        pii_reason: Explain why the PII is collected. (NOTE: This may be more appropriately addressed with the data types, rather than the components.)
        # Cardinality 1 or more
        pii_safeguard: Describe safeguards for protecting the PII relative to this component.

    # Attachment Sections 3.2 thru 3.10 
    # These are a series of questions. Most require a text-field response. One also requires a yes/no response.
    # Cardinality 36
    pia_question: 
        # Cardinality 1
        question_text: The FedRAMP question

        # Cardinality 1 or more (one quesiton has a yes/no, and a text response if yes, which requires two responses in that case. All others are a single text field response.)
        response_type: typically "text" or "boolean" - indicates the type of response required.
        response_text: The response provided by the CSP

    signatures:
        assessor_signature
        chief_privacy_officer_signature
```

### Attachment 5: Rules of Behavior
- This is typically not structured information. 
- With the OSCAL SSP format, this will only exist as an entry in the &lt;attachments&gt; element that points to the external documents.
- This will continue to be handled only as an attachment. The content will not appear in the OSCAL SSP format at this time. 

### Attachment 6: Information System Contingency Plan
- This is typically not structured information. 
- With the OSCAL SSP format, this will only exist as an entry in the &lt;attachments&gt; element that points to the external documents.
- This will continue to be handled only as an attachment. The content will not appear in the OSCAL SSP format at this time. 

### Attachment 7: Configuration Management Plan
- This is typically not structured information. 
- With the OSCAL SSP format, this will only exist as an entry in the &lt;attachments&gt; element that points to the external documents.
- This will continue to be handled only as an attachment. The content will not appear in the OSCAL SSP format at this time. 

### Attachment 8: Incident Response Plan
- This is typically not structured information. 
- With the OSCAL SSP format, this will only exist as an entry in the &lt;attachments&gt; element that points to the external documents.
- This will continue to be handled only as an attachment. The content will not appear in the OSCAL SSP format at this time. 

### Attachment 9: CIS Workbook
- This will exist as a summary view of control information
- There is no additional information in this summary view. It is simply a reduction of control information that already exists in the complete detail of each control. 

### Attachment 10: FIPS 199
- This is structured information
- This is a more detailed version of the information that exists in Table 2-2. The two will be combined into one structure, with different views of the data presented by tools to re-create Table 2-2 and Table 15-9. 

### Attachment 11: Separaton of Duties Matrix
- There is no set template for this; however, this is structured information
- The syntax for expressing the system's user roles (Table 9-1) will be extended to enable basic separation of duties information.
- Until this has more maturity, the CSP will have the option of either using the extended syntax, or attaching their own matrix.

### Attachment 12: FedRAMP Laws and Regulations
- The syntax ... **** 

### Attachment 13: FedRAMP Inventory Workbook
- This is structured information, and will appear in in the OSCAL SSP structure as follows:
