Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official for privacy. External system accounts are not included in the scope of this control. Organizations address external system accounts through organizational policy.\nWhere access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy on establishing the specific conditions for group and role membership; specifying for each account, authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations; and creating, adjusting, or removing system accounts in accordance with organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors triggering the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect system availability.\nTemporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network resources are unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group account credentials when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former group members do not retain access to the shared or group account.

An example of dynamic privilege management is the immediate revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user privileges if they are operating out of their normal work times, their job function or assignment changes, or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations.

The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to which the system has control; otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented.

Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization; keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet; restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server; and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only); verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected system; employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or privacy attributes and security or privacy labels.\nOrganizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and/or inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-domain solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.

Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. Privacy attributes, which may be used independently, or in conjunction with security attributes, represent the basic properties or characteristics of active or passive entities with respect to the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes can be either explicitly or implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational systems or system components.\nAttributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of attributes to subjects and objects by a system is referred to as binding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Attributes, when bound to data or information, permit the enforcement of security and privacy policies for access control and information flow control, including data retention limits, permitted uses of personally identifiable information, and identification of personal information within data objects. Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions or mechanisms. The binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength of attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques play an important part in the trust organizations have in the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by organizations. The content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.\nOrganizations can define the types of attributes needed for systems to support missions or business functions. There are many values that can be assigned to a security attribute. Release markings include US only, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), or NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying the permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations ensure that attribute values are meaningful and relevant. Labeling refers to the association of attributes with the subjects and objects represented by the internal data structures within systems. This facilitates system-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Labels include classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements; access authorizations; nationality; data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration); personally identifiable information processing permissions; individual consent to personally identifiable information processing; and affiliation as a contractor. Conversely, marking refers to the association of attributes with objects in a human-readable form. Marking enables manual, procedural, or process-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies.

Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.\nDue to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.\nUsage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to the organizational network and impose a set of usage restrictions while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or may impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system. The need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many controls for mobile devices are reflected in other controls allocated to the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some overlap by the security controls within the different families of controls.

Active entities, also known as subjects, are associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are associated with data structures such as records, buffers, communications ports, tables, files, and inter-process pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control policies that restrict access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The system enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamperproof property of the reference monitor prevents determined adversaries from compromising the functioning of the mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and hence violating the security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect any weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security policy."}]}]},{"id":"at","class":"family","title":"Awareness and Training","controls":[{"id":"at-1","class":"SP800-53","title":"Policy and Procedures","parameters":[{"id":"at-1_prm_1","label":"organization-defined personnel or roles"},{"id":"at-1_prm_2","select":{"how-many":"one or more","alternatives":["organization-level","mission/business process-level","system-level"]}},{"id":"at-1_prm_3","label":"organization-defined official"},{"id":"at-1_prm_4","label":"organization-defined frequency"},{"id":"at-1_prm_5","label":"organization-defined frequency"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AT-1"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"AT-01"}],"links":[{"href":"#a646d45d-775f-4887-86d3-5a00ffbc4090","rel":"reference","text":"[OMB A-130]"},{"href":"#12702585-0c72-43c9-9185-a76a59f74233","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-12]"},{"href":"#1d9f757b-00d5-4db1-b15b-0ad641c6df7c","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-30]"},{"href":"#451e9636-402e-4c27-b3f5-e0e50f957f27","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-39]"},{"href":"#2e29c363-d5be-47ba-92f5-f8a58a69b65e","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-50]"},{"href":"#9183bd83-170e-4701-b32c-97e08ef8bedb","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-100]"},{"href":"#pm-9","rel":"related","text":"PM-9"},{"href":"#ps-8","rel":"related","text":"PS-8"},{"href":"#si-12","rel":"related","text":"SI-12"}],"parts":[{"id":"at-1_smt","name":"statement","parts":[{"id":"at-1_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"a."}],"prose":"Develop, document, and disseminate to {{ at-1_prm_1 }}:","parts":[{"id":"at-1_smt.a.1","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"1."}],"prose":"\n                     {{ at-1_prm_2 }} awareness and training policy that:","parts":[{"id":"at-1_smt.a.1.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and"},{"id":"at-1_smt.a.1.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(b)"}],"prose":"Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and"}]},{"id":"at-1_smt.a.2","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"2."}],"prose":"Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the awareness and training policy and the associated awareness and training controls;"}]},{"id":"at-1_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"b."}],"prose":"Designate an {{ at-1_prm_3 }} to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the awareness and training policy and procedures; and"},{"id":"at-1_smt.c","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"c."}],"prose":"Review and update the current awareness and training:","parts":[{"id":"at-1_smt.c.1","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"1."}],"prose":"Policy {{ at-1_prm_4 }}; and"},{"id":"at-1_smt.c.2","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"2."}],"prose":"Procedures {{ at-1_prm_5 }}."}]}]},{"id":"at-1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"This control addresses policy and procedures for the controls in the AT family implemented within systems and organizations.

The types of events that require logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the privacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types include password changes; failed logons or failed accesses related to systems; security or privacy attribute changes; administrative privilege usage; PIV credential usage; data action changes; query parameters; or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are operational and supported by the system.\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, this control also requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization. Organizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals that may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the potential for personally identifiable information in the audit trail especially if the logging event is based on patterns or time of usage.\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-16(11), AC-17(1), CM-3.f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-8, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems.

Organizations conduct assessments on the implemented controls as documented in security and privacy plans. Assessments can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of systems engineering and systems security engineering processes. For example, the design for the controls can be assessed as RFPs are developed and responses assessed, and as design reviews are conducted. If design to implement controls and subsequent implementation in accordance with the design is assessed during development, the final control testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing previously completed control assessment and aggregating the outcomes.\nOrganizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment plan for the system or maintain separate plans. A consolidated assessment plan clearly delineates roles and responsibilities for control assessment. If multiple organizations participate in assessing a system, a coordinated approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs.\nOrganizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during the system life cycle. Assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting requirements. Assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials, senior agency officials for privacy, senior agency information security officers, and authorizing official designated representatives.\nTo satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations; continuous monitoring; systems engineering processes, or system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed.

Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of systems and/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions.

Organizations consider the risk related to new or increased threats, that may be introduced when systems exchange information with other systems that may have different security and privacy requirements and controls. This includes systems within the same organization and systems that are external to the organization. A joint authorization of the systems exchanging information as described in CA-6(1) or CA-6(2) may help to communicate and reduce risk.\nAuthorizing officials determine the risk associated with system information exchange and the controls needed for appropriate risk mitigation. The type of agreement selected is based on factors such as the impact level of the information being exchanged, the relationship between the organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government to business, business to business, government or business to service provider, government or business to individual), or the level of access to the organizational system by users of the other system. If systems that exchange information have the same authorizing official, organizations need not develop agreements. Instead, the interface characteristics between the systems (e.g., how the information is being exchanged; how the information is protected) are described in the respective security and privacy plans.

Moreover, integrated teams promote the rapid detection of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing cyber intelligence development. Integrated incident response teams are better able to identify adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures that are linked to the operations tempo or to specific missions and business functions, and to define responsive actions in a way that does not disrupt those missions and business functions.

Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Controlled unclassified information is defined by the National Archives and Records Administration along with the appropriate safeguarding and dissemination requirements for such information and is codified in [32 CFR 2002]. Security marking is generally not required for media containing information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. However, some organizations may require markings for public information indicating that the information is publicly releasable. System media marking reflects applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines."}]},{"id":"mp-4","class":"SP800-53","title":"Media Storage","parameters":[{"id":"mp-4_prm_1","label":"organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media"},{"id":"mp-4_prm_2","label":"organization-defined controlled areas"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MP-4"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"MP-04"}],"links":[{"href":"#b3e26423-0687-47c7-ba9a-a96870d58a27","rel":"reference","text":"[FIPS 199]"},{"href":"#77dc1838-3664-4faa-bc6e-4e2a16e52f35","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-56A]"},{"href":"#f417e4ec-cadb-47a8-a363-6006b32c28ad","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-56B]"},{"href":"#7c3ba335-62bd-4f03-888f-960790409b11","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-56C]"},{"href":"#770f9bdc-4023-48ef-8206-c65397f061ea","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-57-1]"},{"href":"#69644a9e-438a-47c3-bac9-cf28b5baf848","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-57-2]"},{"href":"#9933c883-e8f3-4a83-9a9a-d1e058038080","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-57-3]"},{"href":"#1b14b50f-7154-4226-958c-7dfff8276755","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-111]"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#cp-2","rel":"related","text":"CP-2"},{"href":"#cp-6","rel":"related","text":"CP-6"},{"href":"#cp-9","rel":"related","text":"CP-9"},{"href":"#cp-10","rel":"related","text":"CP-10"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related","text":"MP-2"},{"href":"#mp-7","rel":"related","text":"MP-7"},{"href":"#pe-3","rel":"related","text":"PE-3"},{"href":"#pl-2","rel":"related","text":"PL-2"},{"href":"#sc-13","rel":"related","text":"SC-13"},{"href":"#sc-28","rel":"related","text":"SC-28"},{"href":"#sc-34","rel":"related","text":"SC-34"},{"href":"#si-12","rel":"related","text":"SI-12"}],"parts":[{"id":"mp-4_smt","name":"statement","parts":[{"id":"mp-4_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"a."}],"prose":"Physically control and securely store {{ mp-4_prm_1 }} within {{ mp-4_prm_2 }}; and"},{"id":"mp-4_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"b."}],"prose":"Protect system media types defined in MP-4a until the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures."}]},{"id":"mp-4_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"System media includes digital and non-digital media.

satisfy the requirements. The plans describe the intended application of each selected control in the context of the system with a sufficient level of detail to correctly implement the control and to subsequently assess the effectiveness of the control. The control documentation describes how system-specific and hybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of the system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development of systems in support of life cycle-based security engineering processes. System security and privacy plans are living documents that are updated and adapted throughout the system development life cycle, for example, during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for proposal, and design reviews. Section 2.1 describes the different types of requirements that are relevant to organizations during the system development life cycle and the relationship between requirements and controls.\nOrganizations may develop a single, integrated security and privacy plan or maintain separate plans. Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to a set of controls and control enhancements. The plans describe how the controls and control enhancements meet the security and privacy requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls and control enhancements. Security and privacy plans contain sufficient information (including specifications of control parameter values for selection and assignment statements explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented. Organizations can also apply the tailoring guidance to the control baselines in [SP 800-53B] to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, missions, business applications, or environments of operation.\nSecurity and privacy plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a collection of various documents, including documents that already exist. Effective security and privacy plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents, including design and implementation specifications where more detailed information can be obtained. The use of references helps to reduce the documentation associated with security and privacy programs and maintains the security- and privacy-related information in other established management and operational areas, including enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition.

The architectures can also include other information, for example, user roles and the access privileges assigned to each role; security and privacy requirements; types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system; restoration priorities of information and system services; and other protection needs.\n[SP 800-160 v1] provides guidance on the use of security architectures as part of the system development life cycle process. [OMB M-19-03] requires the use of the systems security engineering concepts described in [SP 800-160 v1] for high value assets. Security and privacy architectures are reviewed and updated throughout the system development life cycle from analysis of alternatives through review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses, to the design reviews before and during implementation (e.g., during preliminary design reviews and critical design reviews).\nIn today’s modern computing architectures, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy architectures is necessary for developing a comprehensive mission and business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational systems is critical to implementing and maintaining effective architectures. The development of the architectures is coordinated with the senior agency information security officer and the senior agency official for privacy to ensure that controls needed to support security and privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented.\nPL-8 is primarily directed at organizations to ensure that architectures are developed for the system, and moreover, that the architectures are integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at the external information technology product and system developers and integrators.

Information protection and personally identifiable information processing needs are derived from the mission and business needs defined by the stakeholders in organizations, the mission and business processes defined to meet those needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information protection and personally identifiable information processing needs determine the required controls for the organization and the systems. Inherent in defining protection and personally identifiable information processing needs, is an understanding of adverse impact that could result if a compromise or breach of information occurs. The categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations. Privacy risks to individuals can arise from the compromise of personally identifiable information, but they can also arise as unintended consequences or a byproduct of authorized processing of information at any stage of the data life cycle.

The same standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified and other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations to prepare department or agency insider threat policies and implementation plans; conduct host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers; provide insider threat awareness training to employees; receive access to information from offices in the department or agency for insider threat analysis; and conduct self-assessments of department or agency insider threat posture.\nInsider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace, including ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues. These precursors can guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. However, the use of human resource records could raise significant concerns for privacy.

Risk assessment is an ongoing activity carried out throughout the system development life cycle.\nIn addition to the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system, risk assessments can also address any information related to the system, including system design, the intended use of the system, testing results, and other supply chain-related information or artifacts. Assessments of risk can play an important role in control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance and in the earliest phases of capability determination."}],"controls":[{"id":"ra-3.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Supply Chain Risk Assessment","parameters":[{"id":"ra-3.1_prm_1","label":"organization-defined systems, system components, and system services"},{"id":"ra-3.1_prm_2","label":"organization-defined frequency"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"RA-3(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"RA-03(01)"}],"links":[{"href":"#ra-2","rel":"related","text":"RA-2"},{"href":"#ra-9","rel":"related","text":"RA-9"},{"href":"#pm-17","rel":"related","text":"PM-17"},{"href":"#sr-2","rel":"related","text":"SR-2"}],"parts":[{"id":"ra-3.1_smt","name":"statement","parts":[{"id":"ra-3.1_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Assess supply chain risks associated with {{ ra-3.1_prm_1 }}; and"},{"id":"ra-3.1_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(b)"}],"prose":"Update the supply chain risk assessment {{ ra-3.1_prm_2 }}, when there are significant changes to the relevant supply chain, or when changes to the system, environments of operation, or other conditions may necessitate a change in the supply chain."}]},{"id":"ra-3.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Supply chain-related events include disruption, use of defective components, insertion of counterfeits, theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery practices, and insertion of malicious code.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, sensors), networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. The capability to readily update vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced, and as new scanning methods are developed, helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by employed vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers.\nVulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning. Vulnerability monitoring tools that facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP) validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments such as red team exercises provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).\nVulnerability monitoring also includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including notification authorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations generally expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization, and can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization for remediation.\nOrganizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as “bug bounties”) to further encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs can be tailored to the organization’s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely or over a defined period of time, and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group. Organizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously, and could choose to offer partially credentialed access to certain participants in order to evaluate security vulnerabilities from privileged vantage points."}],"controls":[{"id":"ra-5.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Update Tool Capability","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"RA-5(1)"},{"name":"status","value":"Withdrawn"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"RA-05(01)"}],"links":[{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"incorporated-into","text":"RA-5"}]},{"id":"ra-5.2","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Update System Vulnerabilities","parameters":[{"id":"ra-5.2_prm_1","select":{"how-many":"one or more","alternatives":["\n                     {{ ra-5.2_prm_2 }}\n                  ","prior to a new scan","when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported"]}},{"id":"ra-5.2_prm_2","depends-on":"ra-5.2_prm_1","label":"organization-defined frequency"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"RA-5(2)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"RA-05(02)"}],"links":[{"href":"#si-5","rel":"related","text":"SI-5"}],"parts":[{"id":"ra-5.2_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Update the system vulnerabilities to be scanned {{ ra-5.2_prm_1 }}."},{"id":"ra-5.2_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Due to the complexity of modern software and systems and other factors, new vulnerabilities are discovered on a regular basis.

A privacy impact assessment is both an analysis and a formal document detailing the process and the outcome of the analysis.\nOrganizations conduct and develop a privacy impact assessment with sufficient clarity and specificity to demonstrate that the organization fully considered privacy and incorporated appropriate privacy protections from the earliest stages of the organization’s activity and throughout the information life cycle. In order to conduct a meaningful privacy impact assessment, the organization’s senior agency official for privacy works closely with program managers, system owners, information technology experts, security officials, counsel, and other relevant organization personnel. Moreover, a privacy impact assessment is not a time-restricted activity that is limited to a particular milestone or stage of the information system or personally identifiable information life cycles. Rather, the privacy analysis continues throughout the system and personally identifiable information life cycles. Accordingly, a privacy impact assessment is a living document that organizations update whenever changes to the information technology, changes to the organization’s practices, or other factors alter the privacy risks associated with the use of such information technology.\nTo conduct the privacy impact assessment, organizations can use security and privacy risk assessments. Organizations may also use other related processes which may have different labels, including privacy threshold analyses.

Criticality analysis is a key tenet of, for example, supply chain risk management, and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders regulations, directives, policies, and standards; system functionality requirements; system and component interfaces; and system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of organizational missions supported by the system; decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions; and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and  external to the system.\nThe operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality, including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of-systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported by the system containing the components and functions. Criticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If such analysis is performed early in the system development life cycle, organizations may be able to modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and functions, for example, by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. Criticality analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development contractors. In addition to criticality analysis for systems, system components, and system services, criticality analysis of information is an important consideration. Such analysis is conducted as part of security categorization in RA-2."}]},{"id":"ra-10","class":"SP800-53","title":"Threat Hunting","parameters":[{"id":"ra-10_prm_1","label":"organization-defined frequency"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"RA-10"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"RA-10"}],"links":[{"href":"#1d9f757b-00d5-4db1-b15b-0ad641c6df7c","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-30]"},{"href":"#ra-3","rel":"related","text":"RA-3"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related","text":"RA-5"},{"href":"#ra-6","rel":"related","text":"RA-6"}],"parts":[{"id":"ra-10_smt","name":"statement","parts":[{"id":"ra-10_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"a."}],"prose":"Establish and maintain a cyber threat hunting capability to:","parts":[{"id":"ra-10_smt.a.1","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"1."}],"prose":"Search for indicators of compromise in organizational systems; and"},{"id":"ra-10_smt.a.2","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"2."}],"prose":"Detect, track, and disrupt threats that evade existing controls; and"}]},{"id":"ra-10_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"b."}],"prose":"Employ the threat hunting capability {{ ra-10_prm_1 }}."}]},{"id":"ra-10_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Threat hunting is an active means of cyber defense in contrast to the traditional protection measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, quarantining malicious code in sandboxes, and Security Information and Event Management technologies and systems.

For example, the root certificate of a certificate hierarchy is the most trusted node in the hierarchy, whereas the leaves in the hierarchy may be the least trustworthy nodes. Another example occurs in a layered high-assurance system where the security kernel (including the hardware base), which is located at the lowest layer of the system, is the most trustworthy component.

Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in all aspects of the secure system design. Interfaces used to invoke component capability are available to only certain subsets of the user population, and component design supports a sufficiently fine granularity of privilege decomposition. For example, in the case of an audit mechanism, there may be an interface for the audit manager, who configures the audit settings; an interface for the audit operator, who ensures that audit data is safely collected and stored; and, finally, yet another interface for the audit reviewer, who has need only to view the audit data that has been collected but no need to perform operations on that data.\nIn addition to its manifestations at the system interface, least privilege can be used as a guiding principle for the internal structure of the system itself. One aspect of internal least privilege is to construct modules so that only the elements encapsulated by the module are directly operated upon by the functions within the module.

The principle of secure defaults applies to the initial (i.e., default) configuration of a system as well as to the security engineering and design of access control and other security functions that follow a “deny unless explicitly authorized” strategy. The initial configuration aspect of this principle requires that any “as shipped” configuration of a system, subsystem, or system component does not aid in the violation of the security policy, and can prevent the system from operating in the default configuration for those cases where the security policy itself requires configuration by the operational user.\nRestrictive defaults mean that the system will operate “as-shipped” with adequate self-protection, and is able to prevent security breaches before the intended security policy and system configuration is established. In cases where the protection provided by the “as-shipped” product is inadequate, stakeholders assess the risk of using it prior to establishing a secure initial state. Adherence to the principle of secure defaults guarantees that a system is established in a secure state upon successfully completing initialization. In situations where the system fails to complete initialization, either it will perform a requested operation using secure defaults or it will not perform the operation. Refer to the principles of continuous protection and secure failure and recovery that parallel this principle to provide the ability to detect and recover from failure.\nThe security engineering approach to this principle states that security mechanisms deny requests unless the request is found to be well-formed and consistent with the security policy. The insecure alternative is to allow a request unless it is shown to be inconsistent with the policy. In a large system, the conditions that are satisfied to grant a request that is by default denied are often far more compact and complete than those that would need to be checked in order to deny a request that is by default granted."}]},{"id":"sa-8.24","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Secure Failure and Recovery","parameters":[{"id":"sa-8.24_prm_1","label":"organization-defined systems or system components"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-8(24)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"SA-08(24)"}],"links":[{"href":"#cp-10","rel":"related","text":"CP-10"},{"href":"#cp-12","rel":"related","text":"CP-12"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-8","rel":"related","text":"SC-8"},{"href":"#sc-24","rel":"related","text":"SC-24"},{"href":"#si-13","rel":"related","text":"SI-13"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-8.24_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Implement the security design principle of secure failure and recovery in {{ sa-8.24_prm_1 }}."},{"id":"sa-8.24_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"The principle of secure failure and recovery states that neither a failure in a system function or mechanism nor any recovery action in response to failure leads to a violation of security policy. The principle of secure failure and recovery parallels the principle of continuous protection to ensure that a system is capable of detecting (within limits) actual and impending failure at any stage of its operation (i.e., initialization, normal operation, shutdown, and maintenance) and to take appropriate steps to ensure that security policies are not violated. In addition, when specified, the system is capable of recovering from impending or actual failure to resume normal, degraded, or alternative secure operation while ensuring that a secure state is maintained such that security policies are not violated.\nFailure is a condition in which the behavior of a component deviates from its specified or expected behavior for an explicitly documented input. Once a failed security function is detected, the system may reconfigure itself to circumvent the failed component, while maintaining security, and provide all or part of the functionality of the original system, or completely shut itself down to prevent any further violation of security policies. For this to occur, the reconfiguration functions of the system are designed to ensure continuous enforcement of security policy during the various phases of reconfiguration.\nAnother technique that can be used to recover from failures is to perform a rollback to a secure state (which may be the initial state) and then either shutdown or replace the service or component that failed such that secure operation may resume. Failure of a component may or may not be detectable to the components using it. The principle of secure failure indicates that components fail in a state that denies rather than grants access. For example, a nominally “atomic” operation interrupted before completion does not violate security policy and is designed to handle interruption events by employing higher-level atomicity and rollback mechanisms (e.g., transactions). If a service is being used, its atomicity properties are well-documented and characterized so that the component availing itself of that service can detect and handle interruption events appropriately. For example, a system is designed to gracefully respond to disconnection and support resynchronization and data consistency after disconnection.\nFailure protection strategies that employ replication of policy enforcement mechanisms, sometimes called defense in depth, can allow the system to continue in a secure state even when one mechanism has failed to protect the system. If the mechanisms are similar, however, the additional protection may be illusory, as the adversary can simply attack in series. Similarly, in a networked system, breaking the security on one system or service may enable an attacker to do the same on other similar replicated systems and services. By employing multiple protection mechanisms, whose features are significantly different, the possibility of attack replication or repetition can be reduced. Analyses are conducted to weigh the costs and benefits of such redundancy techniques against increased resource usage and adverse effects on the overall system performance. Additional analyses are conducted as the complexity of these mechanisms increases, as could be the case for dynamic behaviors. Increased complexity generally reduces trustworthiness. When a resource cannot be continuously protected, it is critical to detect and repair any security breaches before the resource is once again used in a secure context."}]},{"id":"sa-8.25","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Economic Security","parameters":[{"id":"sa-8.25_prm_1","label":"organization-defined systems or system components"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-8(25)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"SA-08(25)"}],"links":[{"href":"#ra-3","rel":"related","text":"RA-3"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-8.25_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Implement the security design principle of economic security in {{ sa-8.25_prm_1 }}."},{"id":"sa-8.25_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"The principle of economic security states that security mechanisms are not costlier than the potential damage that could occur from a security breach.

Stakeholder and system design requirements for performance and security are precisely articulated and prioritized. For the system implementation to meet its design requirements and be found acceptable to stakeholders (i.e., validation against stakeholder requirements), the designers adhere to the specified constraints that capability performance needs place on protection needs. The overall impact of computationally intensive security services (e.g., cryptography) are assessed and demonstrated to pose no significant impact to higher-priority performance considerations or are deemed to be providing an acceptable trade-off of performance for trustworthy protection. The trade-off considerations include less computationally intensive security services unless they are unavailable or insufficient. The insufficiency of a security service is determined by functional capability and strength of mechanism. The strength of mechanism is selected with respect to security requirements as well as performance-critical overhead issues (e.g., cryptographic key management) and an assessment of the capability of the threat.\nThe principle of performance security leads to the incorporation of features that help in the enforcement of security policy, but incur minimum overhead, such as low-level hardware mechanisms upon which higher-level services can be built. Such low-level mechanisms are usually very specific, have very limited functionality, and are optimized for performance. For example, once access rights to a portion of memory is granted, many systems use hardware mechanisms to ensure that all further accesses involve the correct memory address and access mode. Application of this principle reinforces the need to design security into the system from the ground up, and to incorporate simple mechanisms at the lower layers that can be used as building blocks for higher-level mechanisms."}]},{"id":"sa-8.27","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Human Factored Security","parameters":[{"id":"sa-8.27_prm_1","label":"organization-defined systems or system components"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-8(27)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"SA-08(27)"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-8.27_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Implement the security design principle of human factored security in {{ sa-8.27_prm_1 }}."},{"id":"sa-8.27_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"The principle of human factored security states that the user interface for security functions and supporting services is intuitive, user friendly, and provides feedback for user actions that affect such policy and its enforcement.

An important benefit of reduced complexity is that it is easier to understand whether the security policy has been captured in the system design, and that fewer vulnerabilities are likely to be introduced during engineering development.

Applying the principle of least privilege limits the scope of the component’s actions, which has two desirable effects. First, the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the system component results in a minimized security impact. Second, the security analysis of the component is simplified. Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in all aspects of the secure system design. Interfaces used to invoke component capability are available to only certain subsets of the user population, and component design supports a sufficiently fine granularity of privilege decomposition. For example, in the case of an audit mechanism, there may be an interface for the audit manager, who configures the audit settings; an interface for the audit operator, who ensures that audit data is safely collected and stored; and, finally, yet another interface for the audit reviewer, who has need only to view the audit data that has been collected but no need to perform operations on that data.\nIn addition to its manifestations at the system interface, least privilege can be used as a guiding principle for the internal structure of the system itself. One aspect of internal least privilege is to construct modules so that only the elements encapsulated by the module are directly operated upon by the functions within the module. Elements external to a module that may be affected by the module’s operation are indirectly accessed through interaction (e.g., via a function call) with the module that contains those elements. Another aspect of internal least privilege is that the scope of a given module or component includes only those system elements that are necessary for its functionality, and that the access modes to the elements (e.g., read, write) are minimal."}]},{"id":"sa-17.8","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Orchestration","parameters":[{"id":"sa-17.8_prm_1","label":"organization-defined critical systems or system components"},{"id":"sa-17.8_prm_2","label":"organization-defined capabilities, by system or component"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-17(8)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"SA-17(08)"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-17.8_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Design {{ sa-17.8_prm_1 }} with coordinated behavior to implement the following capabilities: {{ sa-17.8_prm_2 }}."},{"id":"sa-17.8_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Security resources that are distributed, located at different layers or in different system elements, or are implemented to support different aspects of trustworthiness can interact in unforeseen or incorrect ways.

Examples include distributed control systems (DCS), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and programmable logic controllers (PLC). The term operational technology is used to demonstrate the differences between industrial control systems (ICS) that are typically found in manufacturing and power plants and the information technology (IT) systems that typically support traditional data processing applications. The term Internet of Things (IoT) is used to describe the network of devices (e.g., vehicles, medical devices, wearables, and home appliances) that contain the hardware, software, firmware, and actuators which allow the devices to connect,  interact, and exchange data and information. IoT extends Internet connectivity beyond workstations, notebook computers, smartphones and tablets to physical devices that do not typically have such connectivity. IoT devices can communicate and interact over the Internet, and they can be remotely monitored and controlled. Finally, the term Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is used to describe the sensors, instruments, machines, and other devices that are networked together and use Internet connectivity to enhance industrial and manufacturing business processes and applications.\nThe recent convergence of IT and OT, producing cyber-physical systems, increases the attack surface of organizations significantly and provides attack vectors that are challenging to address.  Unfortunately, most of the current generation of IoT, OT and IIOT devices are not designed with security as a foundational property. Connections to and from such devices are generally not encrypted, do not provide the necessary authentication, are not monitored, and are not logged. As a result, these devices pose a significant cyber threat. In some instances, gaps in IoT, OT, and IIoT security capabilities may be addressed by employing intermediary devices that can provide encryption, authentication, security scanning, and logging capabilities, and preclude the devices from being accessible from the Internet. But such mitigating options are not always available. The situation is further complicated because some of the IoT/OT/IIoT devices are needed for essential missions and functions. In those instances, it is necessary that such devices are isolated from the Internet to reduce the susceptibility to hostile cyber-attacks."}]}]},{"id":"si","class":"family","title":"System and Information Integrity","controls":[{"id":"si-1","class":"SP800-53","title":"Policy and Procedures","parameters":[{"id":"si-1_prm_1","label":"organization-defined personnel or roles"},{"id":"si-1_prm_2","select":{"how-many":"one or more","alternatives":["organization-level","mission/business process-level","system-level"]}},{"id":"si-1_prm_3","label":"organization-defined official"},{"id":"si-1_prm_4","label":"organization-defined frequency"},{"id":"si-1_prm_5","label":"organization-defined frequency"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-1"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"SI-01"}],"links":[{"href":"#a646d45d-775f-4887-86d3-5a00ffbc4090","rel":"reference","text":"[OMB A-130]"},{"href":"#12702585-0c72-43c9-9185-a76a59f74233","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-12]"},{"href":"#9183bd83-170e-4701-b32c-97e08ef8bedb","rel":"reference","text":"[SP 800-100]"},{"href":"#pm-9","rel":"related","text":"PM-9"},{"href":"#ps-8","rel":"related","text":"PS-8"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related","text":"SA-8"},{"href":"#si-12","rel":"related","text":"SI-12"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-1_smt","name":"statement","parts":[{"id":"si-1_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"a."}],"prose":"Develop, document, and disseminate to {{ si-1_prm_1 }}:","parts":[{"id":"si-1_smt.a.1","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"1."}],"prose":"\n                     {{ si-1_prm_2 }} system and information integrity policy that:","parts":[{"id":"si-1_smt.a.1.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and"},{"id":"si-1_smt.a.1.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(b)"}],"prose":"Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and"}]},{"id":"si-1_smt.a.2","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"2."}],"prose":"Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and information integrity policy and the associated system and information integrity controls;"}]},{"id":"si-1_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"b."}],"prose":"Designate an {{ si-1_prm_3 }} to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the system and information integrity policy and procedures; and"},{"id":"si-1_smt.c","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"c."}],"prose":"Review and update the current system and information integrity:","parts":[{"id":"si-1_smt.c.1","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"1."}],"prose":"Policy {{ si-1_prm_4 }}; and"},{"id":"si-1_smt.c.2","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"2."}],"prose":"Procedures {{ si-1_prm_5 }}."}]}]},{"id":"si-1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"This control addresses policy and procedures for the controls in the SI family implemented within systems and organizations.

Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways, including by electronic mail, the world-wide web, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code.\nMalicious code protection mechanisms include both signature- and nonsignature-based technologies. Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software and in custom-built software and could include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational missions and business functions.\nIn situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations rely on other types of controls, including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files."}],"controls":[{"id":"si-3.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Central Management","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"SI-03(01)"}],"links":[{"href":"#pl-9","rel":"related","text":"PL-9"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-3.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"Centrally manage malicious code protection mechanisms."},{"id":"si-3.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Central management addresses the organization-wide management and implementation of malicious code protection mechanisms.

By implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components, organizations can provide a known state computing resource for a specific time-period that does not give adversaries sufficient time to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems and the environments in which those systems operate. Since the APT is a high-end, sophisticated threat regarding capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period, a percentage of attacks will be successful. Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required using protected information and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries in attempting to compromise or breach organizational systems.\nNon-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components by periodically re-imaging components or by using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can be implemented by using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent).

Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking requiring a coordinated effort across an organization building trust relationships and communicating with both internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities involve identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate mitigating actions, developing SCRM plans to document selected mitigating actions, and monitoring performance against plans.\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether a system is fit for purpose; and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans help organizations to focus their resources on the most critical missions and business functions based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk management plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating the plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and associated roles and responsibilities.
