   <!-- This should error with 'CONTESTED CONTROLS' meaning it invokes controls
        (or subcontrols) with the same ids as other controls invoked.
        The IDs should scope universally - perhaps by @id plus an identifier
          for the ur-source catalog (not a deriving profile)
        For now only @id is being examined; catalogs are expected to have exclusive (nonoverlapping) @id schemes.
