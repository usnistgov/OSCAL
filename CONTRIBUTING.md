# Contributing to the OSCAL Project

This page is for potential contributors to the OSCAL project. It provides basic information on the OSCAL project, describes the main ways people can make contributions, explains how to report issues with OSCAL, and lists pointers to additional sources of information.

## Project approach

The approach we’re taking with OSCAL is agile. We’re adopting the philosophy of implementing the 20% of the functionality that solves 80% of the problem. We’re trying to focus on the core capabilities that are needed to provide the greatest amount of benefit. Because we’re working on a small set of capabilities, that allows us to make very fast progress. We’re building the features that we believe solve the biggest problems, so we’re providing the most value.

## Contribution options

The OSCAL project is producing several types of deliverables, including the following:
 * *XML schemas* for the OSCAL component models  
 * *Schematron definitions*, which are basically an extension of the XML schemas that provide more validation capabilities
 * *XSL templates* for production of human-readable versions of OSCAL XML content 
 * *CSS*, so people who are developing catalogs and profiles using XML tools can use CSS for data entry, which offers a much more usable interface 
 * *Documentation* to define the OSCAL component models, capture the operational model of how to use OSCAL, and explain how you can convert existing content (catalogs, profiles, etc.) into OSCAL formats

Contributions are welcome in any of these areas. For information on the project's current needs and priorities, see the project's GitHub issue tracker (discussed below).

## Issue reporting and handling

All requests for changes and enhancements to OSCAL are initiated through the project's GitHub issue tracker (https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues). To initiate a request, please create a new issue. The core OSCAL project team regularly reviews the open issues, prioritizes their handling, and updates the issue statuses and comments as needed.

## Communications mechanisms

There are two mailing lists for the project:
 * *oscal-dev@nist.gov* for communication among parties interested in contributing to the development of OSCAL or exchanging ideas. Subscribe by visiting https://email.nist.gov/mailman/listinfo/oscal-dev.
 * *oscal-updates@nist.gov* for low-frequency updates on the status of the OSCAL project. To subscribe, visit https://email.nist.gov/mailman/listinfo/oscal-updates.

## Setup instructions

As the OSCAL project matures, instructions will be posted here for how to get the latest OSCAL files from the GitHub repository, set up your environment for OSCAL development/testing, etc. At this time, instructions are limited to README files in the repository that explain what’s on the repository, how the repository is organized, etc.
