Extended data can still be provided using <code>link</code> declarations to external content. This decision can be revisited in future revisions once there is more implementation experience with the OSCAL models.</li><li>Added the following <code>link</code> relations: <code>latest-version</code>, <code>predecessor-version</code>, and <code>successor-version</code> to allow an OSCAL document to link to latest, previous, and next document revisions.</li><li>Fixed a few bugs in the profile resolver code and updated the resolver to work with new profile import/insert structures.</li><li>Provided support for data insertion points for data other than parameters in markup content.</li></ul><p>These changes were made based on all the excellent feedback we received from the OSCAL community.

Further development of the OSCAL Assessment and Assessment Results models.</p><p>The OSCAL Assessment and Assessment Results layers of the OSCAL architecture will continue to be developed as part of the OSCAL 2.0.0 release. This phase of development will focus on integrating automated means of collecting assessment data using existing assessment technologies.</p><p>This assessment development work has been split from the earlier OSCAL v1 epic to allow a stable version of OSCAL formats to be released and maintained that provide a solid foundation for publishing control catalog and baseline information, and to allow organizations to automate the documentation, maintenance, and human-focused assessment of system implementations. This will allow tool vendors to develop against stable OSCAL v1 releases, while ongoing development of OSCAL v2 continues.</p></article></div><nav aria-label="Table of Contents" class="toc-container usa-layout-docs__sidenav widescreen:grid-col-2 desktop:grid-col-2"><div id=js-toc></div></nav></div></div></main><p class="font-sans-sm text-center" style="margin:1.5rem auto">This page was last updated on January 30, 2022. <button id=main-improve-page onclick="window.location.href='https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/main/docs/content/contribute/roadmap.md'" class="usa-button usa-button--accent-cool">Improve this Page</button></p><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tocbot/4.12.0/tocbot.min.js integrity=sha384-roIHE2HuL+PZHzo8X7MgpHu256WMUJvsKqI2GaUJY3moVp06oLtx0QvZnvZJdcCb crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script><script type=text/javascript src=../../js/site.min.js integrity="sha512-sfbEb8CG+sQthTlQQ3pVhkDVCK3Jnl4488nBxUf+hPO5NhvZs428wgnqOT1rMrzLFWWiLFjzOHDGKEkWRn2eLA=="></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://pages.nist.gov/leaveNotice/js/jquery.leaveNotice-nist.min.js></script><script>$(document).ready(function(){$('a[href*="//"]:not([href*="pages.nist.gov"]):not([href*="www.nist.gov"]):not([href^="#"]):not([href^="/"])').addClass('usa-link usa-link--external'),$('a.usa-link--external').leaveNotice()})</script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/anchor-js/4.3.0/anchor.min.js integrity="sha512-G2OGlm41XXw+fcgDcRPjVYEn7qCY6qiKWNqDGT37SnKh0qtRXTuKZ5/UQR0kDN0PZRNWcGExd3lAeqEH0I36bQ==" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script>anchors.options={placement:'left'},anchors.add()</script><script>tocbot.init({tocSelector:'#js-toc',contentSelector:'#main-content',headingSelector:'h2,h3,h4',includeHtml:!1,collapseDepth:0,hasInnerContainers:!0,orderedList:!1,listClass:'usa-sidenav',extraLinkClasses:'usa-sidenav__item',activeLinkClass:'usa-current',headingsOffset:1,scrollSmoothOffset:0})</script></body></html>
