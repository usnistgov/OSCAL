Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented\n               by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the\n               information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the\n               requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring\n               administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny\n               by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner,\n               or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and\n               privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other\n               attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes\n               required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day,\n               day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations\n               consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades)\n               and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer\n               requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider\n               these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency\n               accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary\n               accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for\n               short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.\n               Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with\n               the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may\n               bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are\n               not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used\n               for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are\n               unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic\n               disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts\n               include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no\n               longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types\n               of information system accounts may require specialized training.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-5","rel":"related","text":"AC-5"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-10","rel":"related","text":"AC-10"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"related","text":"AC-20"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related","text":"AU-9"},{"href":"#ia-2","rel":"related","text":"IA-2"},{"href":"#ia-4","rel":"related","text":"IA-4"},{"href":"#ia-5","rel":"related","text":"IA-5"},{"href":"#ia-8","rel":"related","text":"IA-8"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related","text":"CM-5"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-11","rel":"related","text":"CM-11"},{"href":"#ma-3","rel":"related","text":"MA-3"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related","text":"MA-4"},{"href":"#ma-5","rel":"related","text":"MA-5"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related","text":"PL-4"},{"href":"#sc-13","rel":"related","text":"SC-13"}]},{"id":"ac-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping\n               export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet,\n               blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting\n               web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and\n               limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and\n               content. Transferring information between information systems representing different\n               security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers\n               violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information\n               owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between\n               interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural\n               solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes,\n               for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems\n               (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way\n               information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to\n               reassign security attributes and security labels. Organizations commonly employ\n               information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of\n               information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals,\n               and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow\n               control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information\n               path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g.,\n               gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or\n               establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a\n               packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering\n               capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using\n               document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of\n               filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components)\n               that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22\n               primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering\n               techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented\n               in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are\n               generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology\n               products.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ac-21","rel":"related","text":"AC-21"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-7","rel":"related","text":"CM-7"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related","text":"SA-8"},{"href":"#sc-2","rel":"related","text":"SC-2"},{"href":"#sc-5","rel":"related","text":"SC-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-18","rel":"related","text":"SC-18"}]},{"id":"ac-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ac-4_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4[1]"}],"prose":"the organization defines information flow control policies to control the flow of\n                  information within the system and between interconnected systems; and"},{"id":"ac-4_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4[2]"}],"prose":"the information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow\n                  of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on\n                  organization-defined information flow control policies."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\\n\\ninformation flow control policies\\n\\nprocedures addressing information flow enforcement\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\ninformation system baseline configuration\\n\\nlist of information flow authorizations\\n\\ninformation system audit records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem developers"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy"}]}]},{"id":"ac-5","class":"SP800-53","title":"Separation of Duties","parameters":[{"id":"ac-5_prm_1","label":"organization-defined duties of individuals"}],"properties":[{"name":"priority","value":"P1"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-5"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-05"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-5_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization:","parts":[{"id":"ac-5_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"a."}],"prose":"Separates {{ ac-5_prm_1 }};"},{"id":"ac-5_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"b."}],"prose":"Documents separation of duties of individuals; and"},{"id":"ac-5_smt.c","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"c."}],"prose":"Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of\n                  duties."}]},{"id":"ac-5_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and\n               helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.

External information systems include, for example: (i) personally\n               owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets,\n               personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications\n               devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations,\n               convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or\n               controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information\n               systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and\n               authority of organizations. This control also addresses the use of external\n               information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of organizational\n               information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure\n               as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational\n               information systems. For some external information systems (i.e., information systems\n               operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those\n               agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between those\n               organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms\n               and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not\n               be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are\n               pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established\n               between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such\n               trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or\n               policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel,\n               contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational\n               information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules\n               of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on\n               authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending\n               upon the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may\n               choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local,\n               or tribal governments. This control does not apply to the use of external information\n               systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g.,\n               individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). Organizations\n               establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in\n               accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions\n               address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational\n               information systems from external information systems; and the highest security\n               category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external\n               information systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information\n               systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on\n               organizational personnel using those external systems.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ca-3","rel":"related","text":"CA-3"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related","text":"PL-4"},{"href":"#sa-9","rel":"related","text":"SA-9"}]},{"id":"ac-20_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any\n               trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or\n               maintaining external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to: ","parts":[{"id":"ac-20.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(a)"}],"prose":"access the information system from the external information systems; and"},{"id":"ac-20.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(b)"}],"prose":"process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external\n                  information systems."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing the use of external information systems\\n\\nexternal information systems terms and conditions\\n\\nlist of types of applications accessible from external information systems\\n\\nmaximum security categorization for information processed, stored, or transmitted\n                  on external information systems\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining terms and conditions\n                  for use of external information systems to access organizational systems\\n\\nsystem/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on use of external\n                  information systems"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ac-20.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Limits On Authorized Use","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-20.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-20.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information\n                  system to access the information system or to process, store, or transmit\n                  organization-controlled information only when the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ac-20.1_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external\n                     system as specified in the organization’s information security policy and\n                     security plan; or"},{"id":"ac-20.1_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(b)"}],"prose":"Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements with\n                     the organizational entity hosting the external information system."}]},{"id":"ac-20.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals\n                  using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to\n                  access organizational information systems.

Audit events can\n               include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to\n               information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or\n               third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events,\n               organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to\n               be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs,\n               this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are\n               audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that\n               information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful\n               and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances\n               due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including\n               the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and\n               control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required\n               by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and\n               standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including\n               at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate\n               level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate\n               the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the\n               definition of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such\n               as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are\n               distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented\n               architectures.","links":[{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#au-3","rel":"related","text":"AU-3"},{"href":"#au-12","rel":"related","text":"AU-12"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related","text":"MA-4"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related","text":"MP-2"},{"href":"#mp-4","rel":"related","text":"MP-4"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related","text":"SI-4"}]},{"id":"au-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"au-2.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-2.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the auditable events that the information system must be capable of\n                     auditing;"},{"id":"au-2.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)[2]"}],"prose":"determines that the information system is capable of auditing\n                     organization-defined auditable events;"}]},{"id":"au-2.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(b)"}],"prose":"coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities\n                  requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide\n                  the selection of auditable events;"},{"id":"au-2.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(c)"}],"prose":"provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to\n                  support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents;"},{"id":"au-2.d_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-2.d_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the subset of auditable events defined in AU-2a that are to be audited\n                     within the information system;"},{"id":"au-2.d_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)[2]"}],"prose":"determines that the subset of auditable events defined in AU-2a are to be\n                     audited within the information system;

(ii) FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring;\n               and (iv) system development life cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure\n               that information security is built into organizational information systems; (ii)\n               identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; (iii) provide\n               essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security\n               authorization processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation\n               procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from\n               Appendix F (main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented\n               in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can\n               use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system\n               monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the entire\n               life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient\n               detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and\n               completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented\n               correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to\n               meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls\n               at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those\n               activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes.\n               Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for\n               the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in\n               support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or\n               authorizing official designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment\n               requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources:\n               (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring;\n               or (iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security\n               assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control\n               effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence.\n               Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the\n               results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as\n               needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with OMB policy,\n               organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring.

Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year\n               reauthorization requirements, so separate reauthorization processes are not\n               necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes,\n               critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security plans,\n               security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an\n               ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information system owners with an\n               up-to-date status of the security state of organizational information systems and\n               environments of operation. To reduce the administrative cost of security\n               reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results of continuous monitoring\n               processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization\n               decisions.","links":[{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"related","text":"CA-2"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related","text":"CA-7"},{"href":"#pm-9","rel":"related","text":"PM-9"},{"href":"#pm-10","rel":"related","text":"PM-10"}]},{"id":"ca-6_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ca-6.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(a)"}],"prose":"assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the authorizing official for the\n                  information system;"},{"id":"ca-6.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(b)"}],"prose":"ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for\n                  processing before commencing operations;"},{"id":"ca-6.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(c)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ca-6.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(c)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to update the security authorization;

Auditing of changes\n               includes activities before and after changes are made to organizational information\n               systems and the auditing activities required to implement such changes.","links":[{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related","text":"CA-7"},{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related","text":"CM-2"},{"href":"#cm-4","rel":"related","text":"CM-4"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related","text":"CM-5"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-9","rel":"related","text":"CM-9"},{"href":"#sa-10","rel":"related","text":"SA-10"},{"href":"#si-2","rel":"related","text":"SI-2"},{"href":"#si-12","rel":"related","text":"SI-12"}]},{"id":"cm-3_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"cm-3.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(a)"}],"prose":"determines the type of changes to the information system that must be\n                  configuration-controlled;"},{"id":"cm-3.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(b)"}],"prose":"reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to the information system and\n                  approves or disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for security\n                  impact analyses;"},{"id":"cm-3.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(c)"}],"prose":"documents configuration change decisions associated with the information\n                  system;"},{"id":"cm-3.d_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(d)"}],"prose":"implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information\n                  system;"},{"id":"cm-3.e_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(e)"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-3.e_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(e)[1]"}],"prose":"defines a time period to retain records of configuration-controlled changes to\n                     the information system;"},{"id":"cm-3.e_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(e)[2]"}],"prose":"retains records of configuration-controlled changes to the information system\n                     for the organization-defined time period;"}]},{"id":"cm-3.f_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(f)"}],"prose":"audits and reviews activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to\n                  the information system;"},{"id":"cm-3.g_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(g)"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-3.g_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(g)[1]"}],"prose":"defines a configuration change control element (e.g., committee, board)\n                     responsible for coordinating and providing oversight for configuration change\n                     control activities;"},{"id":"cm-3.g_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-3(g)[2]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency with which the configuration change control element must\n                     convene;

Information technology products for which\n               security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example,\n               mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web,\n               proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input/output devices (e.g., scanners,\n               copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice\n               and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating\n               systems, middleware, and applications.

In addition to\n               information system availability, contingency plans also address other\n               security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission and/or business\n               effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or\n               integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for\n               example, orderly/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a\n               manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when\n               systems are under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident\n               handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning\n               activities are in place and activated in the event of a security incident.","links":[{"href":"#ac-14","rel":"related","text":"AC-14"},{"href":"#cp-6","rel":"related","text":"CP-6"},{"href":"#cp-7","rel":"related","text":"CP-7"},{"href":"#cp-8","rel":"related","text":"CP-8"},{"href":"#cp-9","rel":"related","text":"CP-9"},{"href":"#cp-10","rel":"related","text":"CP-10"},{"href":"#ir-4","rel":"related","text":"IR-4"},{"href":"#ir-8","rel":"related","text":"IR-8"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related","text":"MP-2"},{"href":"#mp-4","rel":"related","text":"MP-4"},{"href":"#mp-5","rel":"related","text":"MP-5"},{"href":"#pm-8","rel":"related","text":"PM-8"},{"href":"#pm-11","rel":"related","text":"PM-11"}]},{"id":"cp-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

This control\n               applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and\n               documented in AC-14; and (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group\n               authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique\n               identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or\n               for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords,\n               tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor\n               authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information\n               systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\n               access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf\n               of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of\n               networks. Network access is access to organizational information systems by users (or\n               processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network\n               connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that\n               involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal\n               networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of\n               encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between\n               organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be\n               treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality\n               and integrity of information traversing the network. Organizations can satisfy the\n               identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the\n               requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the\n               specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the\n               use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are\n               defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number\n               [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token);\n               or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that require\n               devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example,\n               hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart\n               cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD\n               common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the\n               information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification\n               and authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide\n               increased information security. Identification and authentication requirements for\n               other than organizational users are described in

Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security\n               controls and control enhancements meet those security requirements, but do not\n               provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design or implementation of\n               the controls/enhancements. Security plans contain sufficient information (including\n               the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either\n               explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is\n               unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of\n               risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and\n               the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply\n               tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in Appendix D and CNSS\n               Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized\n               requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g.,\n               DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and\n               Access Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on developing\n               overlays. Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection\n               of various documents including documents that already exist. Effective security plans\n               make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents\n               (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can\n               be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security\n               programs and maintains security-related information in other established\n               management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development\n               life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not\n               contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead\n               provide explicitly or by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be\n               accomplished by those

The information security architecture at the individual\n               information system level is consistent with and complements the more global,\n               organization-wide information security architecture described in PM-7 that is\n               integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information\n               security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation\n               of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information\n               for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the\n               protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security\n               architecture can include other important security-related information, for example,\n               user roles and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements,\n               the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information\n               system, restoration priorities of information and information system services, and\n               any other specific protection needs. In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming\n               less common for organizations to control all information resources. There are going\n               to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers.\n               Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to\n               developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing,\n               developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline\n               configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and\n               maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the\n               information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for\n               Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to\n               support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is\n               primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that\n               organizations develop an information security architecture for the information\n               system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to\n               the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security\n               architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information\n               technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used\n               internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is\n               complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of\n               information systems or information system components to external entities, and there\n               is a need to demonstrate/show consistency with the organization’s enterprise\n               architecture and information security architecture.","links":[{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related","text":"CM-2"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#pl-2","rel":"related","text":"PL-2"},{"href":"#pm-7","rel":"related","text":"PM-7"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related","text":"SA-5"},{"href":"#sa-17","rel":"related","text":"SA-17"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r4","rel":"related","text":"Appendix J"}]},{"id":"pl-8_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization: ","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)"}],"prose":"develops an information security architecture for the information system that\n                  describes:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.a.1_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(1)"}],"prose":"the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard to\n                     protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational\n                     information;"},{"id":"pl-8.a.2_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(2)"}],"prose":"how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports the\n                     enterprise architecture;"},{"id":"pl-8.a.3_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(3)"}],"prose":"any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external\n                     services;"}]},{"id":"pl-8.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"pl-8.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to review and update the information security\n                     architecture;"},{"id":"pl-8.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)[2]"}],"prose":"reviews and updates the information security architecture with the\n                     organization-defined frequency to reflect updates in the enterprise\n                     architecture;"}]},{"id":"pl-8.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)"}],"prose":"ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected\n                  in:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)[1]"}],"prose":"the security plan;"},{"id":"pl-8.c_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)[2]"}],"prose":"the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS);

Such testing/evaluation confirms that the required\n               security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the\n               desired security policy, and meeting established security requirements. Security\n               properties of information systems may be affected by the interconnection of system\n               components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes (e.g.,\n               upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may adversely affect\n               previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types of\n               security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate\n               potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as\n               static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three\n               approaches. Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools\n               (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and\n               in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific activities\n               that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing,\n               evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to\n               be applied, and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of\n               security testing/evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with\n               the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or white box testing). The\n               coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type)\n               of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance\n               criteria for security assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence\n               that the plans/processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and\n               protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the\n               security category or classification level of the information system. Contracts may\n               specify documentation protection requirements.","links":[{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"related","text":"CA-2"},{"href":"#cm-4","rel":"related","text":"CM-4"},{"href":"#sa-3","rel":"related","text":"SA-3"},{"href":"#sa-4","rel":"related","text":"SA-4"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related","text":"SA-5"},{"href":"#si-2","rel":"related","text":"SI-2"}]},{"id":"sa-11_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"sa-11.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-11(a)"}],"prose":"requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information\n                  system service to create and implement a security plan;"},{"id":"sa-11.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-11(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-11.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-11(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the depth of testing/evaluation to be performed by the developer of the\n                     information system, system component, or information system service;"},{"id":"sa-11.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-11(b)[2]"}],"prose":"defines the coverage of testing/evaluation to be performed by the developer of\n                     the information system, system component, or information system service;"},{"id":"sa-11.b_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-11(b)[3]"}],"prose":"requires the developer of the information system, system component, or\n                     information system service to perform one or more of the following\n                     testing/evaluation at the organization-defined depth and coverage:","parts":[{"id":"sa-11.b_obj.3.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-11(b)[3][a]"}],"prose":"unit testing/evaluation;"},{"id":"sa-11.b_obj.3.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-11(b)[3][b]"}],"prose":"integration testing/evaluation;"},{"id":"sa-11.b_obj.3.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-11(b)[3][c]"}],"prose":"system testing/evaluation;

If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the\n               necessary security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through\n               appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations implement appropriate compensating\n               security controls or explicitly accept the additional risk.","links":[{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#pe-4","rel":"related","text":"PE-4"}]},{"id":"sc-8_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the information system protects one or more of the following:","parts":[{"id":"sc-8_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-8[1]"}],"prose":"confidentiality of transmitted information; and/or"},{"id":"sc-8_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-8[2]"}],"prose":"integrity of transmitted information."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System and communications protection policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\ninformation system audit records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem developer"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing transmission confidentiality\n                  and/or integrity"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"sc-8.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Cryptographic or Alternate Physical Protection","parameters":[{"id":"sc-8.1_prm_1"},{"id":"sc-8.1_prm_2","label":"organization-defined alternative physical safeguards"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-8(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sc-08.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"sc-8.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to {{ sc-8.1_prm_1 }} during transmission unless otherwise protected by\n                     {{ sc-8.1_prm_2 }}."},{"id":"sc-8.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Encrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized\n                  disclosure and modification.

Malicious code includes, for example,\n               viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in\n               various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden\n               files, or hidden in files using steganography. Malicious code can be transported by\n               different means including, for example, web accesses, electronic mail, electronic\n               mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur\n               through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code\n               protection mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and\n               reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit\n               or eliminate the effects of malicious code.

This could include, for example, logic\n               bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational\n               missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot\n               always detect such code.

External\n               monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system\n               boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal\n               monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information\n               system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by observing\n               audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access\n               patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may\n               guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is\n               achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection\n               systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning\n               tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic\n               locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations\n               and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically\n               being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17.\n               Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can also\n               be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information\n               collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of\n               information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of\n               interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that\n               bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of\n               organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from\n               system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response\n               programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates\n               through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any\n               connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the\n               Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or\n               wireless.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-8","rel":"related","text":"AC-8"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#au-2","rel":"related","text":"AU-2"},{"href":"#au-6","rel":"related","text":"AU-6"},{"href":"#au-7","rel":"related","text":"AU-7"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related","text":"AU-9"},{"href":"#au-12","rel":"related","text":"AU-12"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related","text":"CA-7"},{"href":"#ir-4","rel":"related","text":"IR-4"},{"href":"#pe-3","rel":"related","text":"PE-3"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related","text":"RA-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-26","rel":"related","text":"SC-26"},{"href":"#sc-35","rel":"related","text":"SC-35"},{"href":"#si-3","rel":"related","text":"SI-3"},{"href":"#si-7","rel":"related","text":"SI-7"}]},{"id":"si-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine
