# OSCAL Build Tools

This subdirectory contains infrastructure used to create OSCAL-related artifacts (e.g., schemas, converters) and perform status checks.
Below are instructions for using these tools.

## Prerequisites

The build tools in this directory require a Unix environment with the following software:

- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/): Required to generate artifacts
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (ensure the version matches [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc)): Required to perform link checking
- [`libxml`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/wikis/home): Provides `xmllint` which is required to validate generated XML artifacts

Additionally ensure your environment has standard build tools such as [`git` 2.34.1 or newer](https://git-scm.com/), [`make` 4.3 or newer](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and [`bash` 3.2 or newer for syntax we require](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/NEWS?h=bash-3.2-beta).

## Overview

All OSCAL build targets are defined in a [`Makefile`](./Makefile).
To summarize the build targets, run `make help`.
To generate all artifacts and run all checks, simply run `make all`.

To run targets in parallel, pass a `--jobs <n>` flag, where `<n>` is the number of concurrent jobs and should be `<=` your machine's core count.
Note that running jobs concurrently will make the output harder to follow and debug.

## Artifact Generation

As of `v1.1.0`, artifacts are no longer tracked in the OSCAL git repository ([discussion link](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/discussions/1852)).
Instead artifacts are [generated as part of a release](../.github/workflows/release.yml).

Developers can generate schemas locally using the `make artifacts` command.

Developers can also generate individual artifacts using the following commands:

* `make schemas`: Generates the JSON Schemas and XSDs off of the source Metaschemas;
* `make converters`: Generates the XSLT stylesheets for JSON<->XML conversion off of the source Metaschemas.

## Checks


Developers can run checks using the `make checks` command.

The checks can also be run individually:

* `make linkcheck`: Checks each markdown file in the repository for bad links;
* `make validate-jsonschemas`: Validates that the JSON schemas generated by `make schemas` are schema valid against the JSON Schema specification;
* `make validate-xsds`: Validates that the XSD files generated by `make schemas` are schema valid against the XSD specification;
* `make test-profile-resolution`: Runs the test suite in [`/src/utils/resolver-pipeline`](../src/utils/resolver-pipeline/).
