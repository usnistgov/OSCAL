FedRAMP officials want to continue to make it easier for agencies to get cloud service providers approved. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Open Security Controls Assessment Language, which speeds up the security controls assessment process through standardization and automation, will be available for testing by the end of this fiscal year, FedRAMP Director Matt Goodrich said at  the June 13 ATARC Federal Cloud and Data Center Summit.

OSCAL automates FedRAMP’s security control assessments and tracks associated risks.

“We think [OSCAL] will really help agencies transform the way that they are doing their work by making sure that they can use whatever tool that they want to use and automate whatever they can in the process to do their authorizations,” Goodrich said.

Goodrich also provided an update on FedRAMP Tailored, a streamlined approval process for low-impact software-as-a-service offerings. He said 15 SaaS offerings are currently in process for authorizations with three already approved.

“Agencies can partner with vendors for authorizations, so vendors don’t need to have a third-party assessor or independent auditor,” Goodrich said. It allows agencies to "bring in new and innovative products from small businesses in a way that is cost affordable," he said.
