              Allocation of information security responsibilities should be done in accordance with
              the information security policies. Responsibilities for the protection of individual
              assets and for carrying out specific information security processes should be
              identified. Responsibilities for information security risk management activities and
              in particular for acceptance of residual risks should be defined. These
              responsibilities should be supplemented, where necessary, with more detailed guidance
              for specific sites and information processing facilities. Local responsibilities for
              the protection of assets and for carrying out specific security processes should be
              defined.

              Individuals with allocated information security responsibilities may delegate
              security tasks to others. Nevertheless they remain accountable and should determine
              that any delegated tasks have been correctly performed.

              Areas for which individuals are responsible should be stated. In particular the
              following should take place:

              1. the assets and information security processes should be identified and defined;
              2. the entity responsible for each asset or information security process should be assigned and the details of this responsibility should be documented;
              3. authorization levels should be defined and documented;
              4. to be able to fulfil responsibilities in the information security area the appointed individuals should be competent in the area and be given opportunities to keep up to date with developments;
              5. coordination and oversight of information security aspects of supplier relationships should be identified and documented.

            Many organizations appoint an information security manager to take overall
            responsibility for the development and implementation of information security and to
            support the identification of controls.

            However, responsibility for resourcing and implementing the controls will often remain
            with individual managers. One common practice is to appoint an owner for each asset who
            then becomes responsible for its day-to-day protection.

            Conflicting duties and areas of responsibility should be segregated to reduce

              Care should be taken that no single person can access, modify or use assets without
              authorization or detection. The initiation of an event should be separated from its
              authorization. The possibility of collusion should be considered in designing the
              controls.

              Small organizations may find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the
              principle should be applied as far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is
              difficult to segregate, other controls such as monitoring of activities, audit trails
              and management supervision should be considered.

            Segregation of duties is a method for reducing the risk of accidental or deliberate
            misuse of an organization’s assets.

              The policy should take account of the following:

              1. security requirements of business applications;
              2. policies for information dissemination and authorization, e.g. the need-to-know principle and information security levels and classification of information;
              3. consistency between the access rights and information classification policies of systems and networks;
              4. relevant legislation and any contractual obligations regarding limitation of access to data or services;
              5. management of access rights in a distributed and networked environment which recognizes all types of connections availabel;
              6. segregation of access control roles, e.g. access request, access authorization, access administration;
              7. requirements for formal authorization of access requests;
              8. requirements for periodic review of access rights;
              9. removal of access rights;
              10. archiving of records of all significant events concerning the use and management of user identities and secret authentication information;,
              11. roles with privileged access.

              Care should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider:

              1. establishing rules based on the premise “Everything is generally forbidden unless expressly permitted” rather than the weaker rule “Everything is generally permitted unless expressly forbidden”;
              2. changes in information labels that are initiated automatically by information processing facilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user;
              3. changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those initiated by an administrator;
              4. rules which require specific approval before enactment and those which do not.

              Role based access control is an approach used successfully by many organizations to

              Two of the frequent principles directing the access control policy are:

              1. Need-to-know: you are only granted access to the information you need to perform your tasks (different tasks/roles mean different need-to-know and hence different access profile);
              2. Need-to-use: you are only granted access to the information processing facilities (IT equipment, applications, procedures, rooms) you need to perform your task/job/role.

              A policy should be formulated concerning the use of networks and network services.
              This policy should cover:

              1. the networks and network services which are allowed to be accessed;
              2. authorization procedures for determining who is allowed to access which networks and networked services;
              3. management controls and procedures to protect access to network connections and network services;
              4. the means used to access networks and network services (e.g. use of VPN or wireless network);
              5. user authentication requirements for accessing various network services;
              6. monitoring of the use of network service
